'''Helena Winifred Carroll''' (13 November 1928 – 31 March 2013) was a veteran film, television and stage actress. Born to clothing designer Helena Reilly and [[Abbey Theatre]] playwright [[Paul Vincent Carroll]], she was the youngest of three sisters. Her elder sisters were Theresa Elizabeth Perez (1924-2001), a classically trained musician and the producer/founder of the ''People's Pops Concerts'' in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], and journalist Kathleen Moira Carroll (1927-2007). 
Miss Carroll attended Clerkhill [[Notre Dame High School (Glasgow)|Notre Dame High School]], a Roman Catholic convent school in [[Dumbarton]]. She received her training at the Central School which later became the [[Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art]] London, appearing in three plays in [[London's West End]] and a film, ''[[Midnight Episode]]'', by age 20. She made her Broadway debut in ''[[Separate Tables]]'' by [[Terence Rattigan]]. She moved to the U.S. during the 1950s, touring and performing on Broadway and co-founded, with Dermot McNamara, {{Who?|date=April 2013}} The Irish Players, a repertory theater company in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/11/movies/helena-carroll-actress-and-irish-players-co-founder-dies-at-84.html?ref=obituaries Obituary for Helena Carroll], ''New York Times'', 11 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
At the dawn of television, Miss Carroll played the leading role of Nora, in a television production of her father's play, ''[[The White Steed]]'' (1959 Play of the Week Series), directed by [[Joe Gisterak]]. Gisterak directed a 1980 commissioned opera of her father's play, ''Beauty is Fled'', as part of the &quot;Children's Opera Series&quot;, which her sister,  Theresa Perez founded. The opera was performed at the [[Phoenix Symphony Hall]]. 
Helena split her stage work between Dublin, London and New York, appearing on Broadway in, among other productions the original production of ''[[Oliver!]]'' as Mrs. Sowerberry, as well as ''[[Pickwick (musical)|Pickwick]]'', ''[[Design for Living]]'', ''[[Waiting in the Wings (play)|Waiting in the Wings]]'', and the [[Elizabeth Taylor]]-[[Richard Burton]] revivals of ''[[Private Lives]]'' (New York and Los Angeles).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=73575 Helena Carroll's IBDb profile]; accessed 13 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Prompted by friends who had preceded her to Los Angeles, producer Al Simon and casting director Caro Jones (the latter of whom gave Les Moonves, now president of CBS, his first job in the biz), Carroll moved to Los Angeles in the late 1960s and appeared in numerous films and television programs, including [[John Huston]]'s [[Academy Award]] nominated film ''[[The Dead (short story)|The Dead]]'', ''[[The Friends of Eddie Coyle]]'' starring [[Robert Mitchum]], ''[[The Jerk (film)|The Jerk]]'', directed by [[Carl Reiner]] and starring [[Steve Martin]], ''[[The Mambo Kings]]'', the [[Warren Beatty]] remake of ''[[Love Affair (1994 film)|Love Affair]]'', and such television programs as ''[[General Hospital]]'', ''[[Edge of Night]]'', ''[[Loving Couples (1980 film)|Loving Couples]]'', ''[[Laverne and Shirley]]'', ''[[Murder She Wrote]]'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0140833 Helena Carroll's IMDb profile]; accessed 13 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Death==
Carroll resided in Los Angeles, and died in [[Marina del Rey, California]] from heart failure on 31 March 2013 at the age of 84. Her last stage performance was in 2007 at the age of 78. She is survived by a half brother, Brian Carroll; a niece, Helena Perez Reilly; and a great-nephew, Paul Vincent Reilly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://variety.com/2013/legit/people-news/obituaries-people-news/irish-thesp-helena-carroll-dies-at-84-1200332626 Obituary for Helena Carroll in ''Variety'']; accessed 13 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''(Giuseppe) Mario Sammarco''' (December 13, 1868, although some sources say 1867 – January 24, 1930) was an Italian operatic [[baritone]] noted for his acting ability.
==Biography==
Sammarco was born in [[Palermo]], [[Sicily]], and studied locally with Antonio Cantelli. He made his operatic début in Palermo as Valentine in ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'' in 1888. He subsequently sang to acclaim in [[Milan]] (at [[La Scala]], Italy's most celebrated theatre), [[Buenos Aires]] and London. Between 1904 and 1919 he appeared intermittently, in 26 different roles, at the [[Royal Opera House]], [[Covent Garden]]. 
In New York City, he was hired by [[Oscar Hammerstein I]] for his [[Manhattan Opera Company]] as a replacement for the great French singing-actor [[Maurice Renaud]]. He sang with the Manhattan company in 1908-1910, becoming its principal Italian baritone, but he never 'graduated' to the rival [[Metropolitan Opera]].   
Sammarco next joined the [[Chicago]]&amp;ndash;[[Philadelphia]] opera company. His career there continued smoothly enough until 1913 when he encountered a disapproving [[Mary Garden]] in a Chicago production of ''[[Tosca]]''. The soprano requested that he be replaced; but after he named some of his former distinguished (and uncomplaining) Tosca partners, notably [[Emmy Destinn]], the performances proceeded to be given to critical success.
His final operatic appearances were at the [[Teatro di San Carlo]] in Naples in 1919. 
Apart from Scarpia (his debut role at Covent Garden), he was a famous Rigoletto, Marcello, Germont, Renato, Enrico and Amleto, appearing opposite some of the finest singers of his day. No [[bel canto]] specialist, he was at his best in ardent [[verismo]] works, creating the roles of Gerard in [[Umberto Giordano|Giordano]]'s ''[[Andrea Chénier]]'' in 1896 and Cascart in [[Ruggiero Leoncavallo|Leoncavallo]]'s ''[[Zazà]]'' in 1900.
Sammarco was active during an era that was thronged with Italian baritones of exceptional ability. It was no small achievement for him to carve out a lucrative international career in the face of powerful competition from the likes of [[Mattia Battistini]], [[Antonio Magini-Coletti]], [[Giuseppe Campanari]], [[Mario Ancona]], Giuseppe Pacini, [[Antonio Scotti]], [[Eugenio Giraldoni]], [[Riccardo Stracciari]], [[Titta Ruffo]], [[Domenico Viglione Borghese]], [[Pasquale Amato]] and [[Carlo Galeffi]].       
He taught singing after retiring from the stage and died in Milan. 
==Recordings==
Sammarco possessed a strong voice with a powerful upper register; but of all the celebrated singers preserved on early recordings, Sammarco's are regarded as the most disappointing. The technical quality of his singing disappoints and the timbre of his voice can sound rough; at best he is merely dull. On record, according to Scott and Steane, he has a singular inability to sing less than mezzo forte and has no concept of legato. He impresses most when delivering declamatory passages in verismo operas (see Scott, cited below) including an early (celebrated or notorious) recording with the soprano Emma Carelli from Tosca, complete with peals of laughter; even in these &quot;specialist&quot; roles, his singing is unimaginative and crude. Many of the depressingly numerous 78-rpm [[gramophone record]]s that he made prior to [[World War I]] for the Fonotipia, Victor and Pathé companies—and for the forerunner of [[HMV]]—are now available on CD reissues from various labels.

The '''''Colonial''''', also known as the '''''Colonial Express''''', was a service of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] and [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]] between [[Union Station (DC)|Union Station]] in [[Washington, DC]] and [[South Station (Boston)|South Station]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. It was operated until 1973 by [[Amtrak]].
==History==
The ''Colonial'' began on January 18, 1892, as a daytime express service between Boston and Washington. From Boston, the train traveled west over the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford's [[Shore Line]] and then the New Rochelle branch to the [[Harlem River]]. There, passengers boarded the passenger steamer ''Maryland'', which carried them to [[Jersey City, New Jersey]]. At that time the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) had no station in Manhattan, so passengers heading for [[New York City|New York]] traveled to Jersey City, then transferred to Manhattan-bound ferries. Passengers continuing south on the ''Colonial'' boarded a new train in Jersey City, which used the Pennsylvania main line to reach [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], [[Baltimore, Maryland]] and Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=The Colonial Express: Name and Route of the New Train Which Goes on Monday | date=January 14, 1892 | accessdate=2009-12-18 | publisher=''[[The Day (New London)|The Day]]'' | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=n_AgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6XMFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3183,906859&amp;dq=pennsylvania+railroad+colonial&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The sinking of the ocean liner [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] caused a shift in the ''Colonial'''s operation. The waterborne segment was dropped; instead, the Boston train ran into [[Grand Central Terminal]], while the Washington train terminated at [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]], which had opened in 1910. Passengers used ground transport to move between the two stations, which were a little over a mile apart. In 1917 the opening of the [[Hell Gate Bridge]], which linked the PRR and the New Haven, allowed trains to run directly through Penn Station.&lt;ref name=&quot;lynch&quot;&gt;{{Lynch-New Haven passenger | page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The PRR merged into [[Penn Central Transportation]] in 1968, which absorbed the NYNH&amp;H in 1969. When Amtrak began operations on May 1, 1971, it took over the ''Colonial'', which ran as trains 170 and 171 (changed to 173 and 174 in the November 14 timetable). Its last trip was made on April 28, 1973.
In 1976 Amtrak brought the name back for the New York-[[Newport News (VA)|Newport News]] ''[[Colonial (Amtrak 1976)|Colonial]]'' to replace the removed Newport News section of the ''[[James Whitcomb Riley (Amtrak)|James Whitcomb Riley]]''.

[[File:Grand Royal.png|right|frame|Grand Royal Logo]]
'''Grand Royal ''' was the [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]-based [[Vanity label|vanity]] [[record label]] set up in [[1992 in music|1992]] by the [[Beastie Boys]] in conjunction with [[Capitol Records]] after the group left [[Def Jam Recordings]].
Due to mounting debts, Grand Royal went out of business in [[2001 in music|2001]]. Its assets were sold off via auction on [[Bid4Assets]]; these assets did not include any rights to Beastie Boys music. The assets and back catalog were purchased by a group of fans who in turn started [[GR2 Records]].
''Grand Royal'' was also the name of a magazine written and published by the group. It was most famous for its article &quot;Mulling Over the Mullet&quot; in issue two, which lampooned the [[mullet (haircut)|mullet]] hairstyle (the Beastie Boys also recorded a song called &quot;Mullet Head&quot;, which was released on Grand Royal on its ''[[Sure Shot]]'' 12-inch [[single (music)|single]]).

==Early life==
Christian was born as '''Blanca Rosa Welter''' in [[Tampico]], [[Tamaulipas]], [[Mexico]], a daughter of [[Dutch people|Dutch]] engineer and [[Royal Dutch Shell]] executive, Gerardus Jacob Welter (1904–1981),&lt;ref&gt;Birth and death dates given in ''Il coraggio di scrivere,'' Volume 1, by Gianni Ippoliti (Baldini Castoldi Dalai, 1992), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ancestry.com.

Ship Name: Maasdam Port of Arrival: New Orleans, Louisiana. Date of Arrival: Mar 23, 1925.&lt;/ref&gt; and his [[Mexican people|Mexican]]-born wife, the former Blanca Rosa Vorhauer (1901-1992), who was of [[Spanish people|Spanish]], [[Germans|German]] and [[French people|French]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;Birth date given in ''Il Coraggio di Scrivere,'' Volume 1, by Gianni Ippoliti (Baldini Castoldi Dalai, 1992), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Parla|Parla]], pp. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt; The Welter family moved a great deal during Christian's youth, living everywhere from South America and Europe to the Middle East and Africa.&lt;ref name=parla35/&gt; As a result of this nomadic lifestyle, Christian became an accomplished [[Multilingualism|polyglot]] with the ability to speak fluent French, German, Dutch, Spanish, [[English language|English]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and even a bit of haphazard [[Arabic]] and [[Russian language|Russian]].&lt;ref name=parla35/&gt;
Christian had three younger siblings, a sister, actress [[Ariadne Welter|Ariadna Gloria Welter]] (1930–1998), and two brothers, Gerardus Jacob Welter (born 1924) and Edward Albert Welter (born 1932).&lt;ref&gt;Ancestry.com.

==Career==
[[File:Christian-Palma-Tarzan.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Christian and the Mexican actress [[Andrea Palma (actress)|Andrea Palma]] in ''[[Tarzan and the Mermaids]]'' in 1948.]]
In her youth Christian's only aspiration was to become a physician.&lt;ref name=parla36&gt;[[#Parla|Parla]], p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; After she graduated from secondary school she had a fortuitous meeting with her screen idol [[Errol Flynn]], who became her lover, and she was persuaded by him to give up her hopes of joining the medical profession, move to Hollywood, and pursue an acting career.&lt;ref name=parla36/&gt; Not long after arriving in Hollywood she was spotted by [[Louis B. Mayer]]'s secretary at a fashion show in [[Beverly Hills]]. He offered, and she accepted, a seven-year contract with MGM.&lt;ref name=parla37&gt;[[#Parla|Parla]], p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;
Her stage name was invented by Flynn, who gave her the surname of Fletcher Christian of ''Mutiny on the Bounty'' fame. Flynn had played Fletcher Christian in a 1933 Australian film.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas McNulty (2004) ''Errol Flynn: The Life and Career'', McFarland, pp. 165, 166, ISBN 0786417501.&lt;/ref&gt;
In his autobiography, ''[[My Wicked, Wicked Ways]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Errol Flynn (2002) My Wicked, Wicked Ways&quot;, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, ISBN 978-0815412502&lt;/ref&gt; Flynn states that immediately after Linda Christian's screen test, he offered to pay for her to have a couple of crooked teeth fixed. When he got a whopping bill, he discovered that she had taken the opportunity to undergo major cosmetic dentistry. Years later, when he met her again, he said, &quot;Smile, baby – I want to see those choppers: they took their first bite out of me.&quot;
She made her film debut in the 1944 musical comedy ''[[Up in Arms]]'', co-starring [[Danny Kaye]] and [[Dinah Shore]]. This movie also happened to be Danny Kaye's own first film.&lt;ref name=parla37/&gt; This film was followed by ''[[Holiday in Mexico]]'' (1946), ''[[Green Dolphin Street]]'' (1947), and what was perhaps her best-known film, ''[[Tarzan and the Mermaids]]''&lt;ref name=parla37/&gt; (1948). She was the subject of a well-known photograph published in the January 1, 1949, issue of ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]''.
Christian was the first Bond girl to appear on screen, playing Valerie Mathis (opposite Barry Nelson as James Bond) in the 1954 TV adaptation of ''[[Casino Royale (Climax!)|Casino Royale]]'', beating [[Ursula Andress]] to the screen by eight years.
In 2001, a Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs, California]], [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars|Walk of Stars]] was dedicated to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf|format=PDF|title=Palm Springs Walk of Stars by date dedicated|website=palmspringswalkofstars.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Marriages and relationships==
[[File:LindaChristian1966Rotterdam(cropped).jpg|{{largethumb}}|Christian in Rotterdam (1966)]]
Christian's fame, however, was largely derived from having been married to (and [[divorce]]d from) the popular screen idol [[Tyrone Power]]&lt;ref name=parla35/&gt; (1949–56). The couple married in Rome, Italy, at [[Santa Francesca Romana, Rome|Santa Francesca Romana church]]; Christian wore a formfitting gold-damask gown, and the church was decorated with two thousand 'Esther' carnations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tyforum.bravepages.com/artc/oggi-2-3-49.html|title=Magazine Articles - Matrimonio in Technicolor|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She and Power were the parents of singer [[Romina Power]] and actress [[Taryn Power]].&lt;ref name=parla39&gt;[[#Parla|Parla]], p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Romina was one half of the Italian singing duo [[Al Bano and Romina Power]].
A month after she divorced Tyrone Power, Christian was seen with Spanish racing driver [[Alfonso de Portago]], who was married to American Carroll de Portago (later [[Carroll Petrie]]). Carroll had recently given birth to &quot;Fon's&quot; second child Anthony. De Portago was also dating model [[Dorian Leigh]], mother of his recently born illegitimate son Kim. Linda was photographed with de Portago at the 1957 [[Mille Miglia]] car race. The photo shows Christian leaning in to kiss Fon before he drove off and crashed his Ferrari, killing himself, his navigator Ed Nelson and at least ten spectators in the process. The press labeled the photo &quot;The Kiss of Death&quot;. De Portago was 28 years old. Her ex-husband, Tyrone Power, died the following year of a heart attack at the age of 44. Christian was later married to the [[Rome]]-based British actor [[Edmund Purdom]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;
On several occasions Christian and Power were offered the opportunity to work together, but for various reasons each offer was refused or rescinded.&lt;ref name=parla39/&gt; The most notable opportunity to co-star together came in 1953, when they were offered leading roles in ''[[From Here to Eternity]]''. Power did not want to do the film&lt;ref name=parla39/&gt; and rejected the offer. The roles went to [[Donna Reed]] and [[Montgomery Clift]]. 
Linda Christian died on July 22, 2011, at the age of 87.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last =Bergan|first =Ronald|title =Linda Christian obituary|date =26 July 2011|work =The Guardian|url =https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jul/26/linda-christian-obituary|publisher =theguardian.com|accessdate =12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Kentucky Cardinal''''' was a nightly {{convert|312|mile|adj=on}} [[passenger train]] operated by [[Amtrak]] from 1999 to 2003 between [[Chicago, Illinois]], and [[Louisville, Kentucky]], via [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]. On the three days that the ''[[Cardinal (passenger train)|Cardinal]]'' ran, the ''Kentucky Cardinal'' operated as a section, splitting at Indianapolis. On the other four days, it ran on its own to Chicago.
==History==
[[File:Hi-Level coach and express boxcar on the Kentucky Cardinal at Jeffersonville, August 2001.jpg|thumb|left|A typical ''Kentucky Cardinal'' consist: a B32-8WH locomotive (out of frame), a P42DC locomotive, a Hi-Level coach, and a boxcar]]
[[File:Kentucky Cardinal at Louisville, May 2002.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Kentucky Cardinal'' at Louisville in May 2002]]
Between May 1971–August 1974 Amtrak's ''[[Floridian (train)|Floridian]]'' ran from Chicago to [[Florida]] via Indianapolis and Louisville. Due to poor track conditions on the [[Penn Central]] trackage in [[Indiana]], the train was rerouted to the west north of [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. In April 1975 the train was routed back east over the former [[Monon Railroad]], again serving Louisville, but bypassing Indianapolis to the west. The ''Floridian'' served Louisville until its discontinuance in October 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sanders|2006|pp=80–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On December 17, 1999, the ''Kentucky Cardinal'' started running as an extension of the ''[[Hoosier State (passenger train)|Hoosier State]]'', which ran four days a week between Chicago and Indianapolis (filling in the gaps in the ''Cardinal'' schedule). The ''Kentucky Cardinal'' ran as trains 850 southbound and 851 northbound. Three days of the week, it was grouped with the ''[[Cardinal (Amtrak)|Cardinal]]'', trains 50 and 51, north of Indianapolis.
The train, operated along trackage that had last been used by the ''[[Floridian (Amtrak)|Floridian]]'' in 1974, was an attempt to attract express business from [[United Parcel Service]], which maintains its air-express hub at [[Louisville International Airport]]. At first the train only ran from Indianapolis south to [[Jeffersonville, Indiana]], where a new [[Amtrak Mail and Express]] facility was built. The city of Louisville spent $370,000 in 2001 to renovate its [[Union Station (Louisville)|Union Station]] for the service, and on December 4 the ''Kentucky Cardinal'' started to use a new track on the west side of the Union Station [[parking lot]].
The train was handicapped by inconvenient departure and arrival times and slow travel times, especially on the segment from Indianapolis south to Louisville. This segment was operated over the [[Louisville and Indiana Railroad]], which had purchased the line from [[Conrail]] in 1994, and had a speed limit of 30 miles per hour (50&amp;nbsp;km/h) over most of the route due to its [[jointed rail]]. This made travel on the ''Kentucky Cardinal'' slower than [[automobile]] traffic on the parallel [[Interstate 65]].
With the opening in 1999, [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] began running [[Thruway Motorcoach]] bus connections from Jeffersonville south to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], with stops at [[Elizabethtown (KY)|Elizabethtown]] and [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]]. Though rail passenger advocates tried to get the train's route extended to Nashville in an effort to increase ridership, Amtrak lost its mail contract, and the ''Kentucky Cardinal'' last ran July 4, 2003, restoring the old ''Hoosier State'' on July 6 (the ''Cardinal'' ran both ways on July 5).
==Route details==
:''For details north of [[Indianapolis (IN)|Indianapolis]], see [[Hoosier State (passenger train)#Route details|Hoosier State]].''
The tracks used were originally part of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] system, and are now owned by the [[Louisville and Indiana Railroad]]. The following lines were used:
*[[Louisville Bridge and Terminal Railway]] (PRR), [[Louisville, Kentucky]], to [[Clarksville, Indiana]], now L&amp;I
*[[Jeffersonville, Madison and Indianapolis Railroad]] (PRR), Clarksville to [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], now L&amp;I

'''Isaiah Thomas''' (January 19, 1749 – April 4, 1831) was an [[United States|American]] [[History of American newspapers|newspaper publisher]] and author. He performed the first public reading of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], and reported the first account of the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]].  He was the founder of the [[American Antiquarian Society]].
==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Thomas was born in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. He was apprenticed on July 7, 1756 to Zechariah Fowle, a Boston printer, with whom, after working as a printer in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]] ([[New Hampshire]]) and [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] ([[South Carolina]]), he formed a partnership in 1770.&lt;ref&gt;From Colonial Times to the Present. Geraldine Youcha. New York. Scribner. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;
===The ''Massachusetts Spy''===
[[Image:Massachusetts Spy 3a10607u.png|thumb|[[Masthead (publishing)|Masthead]] of July 7, 1774 issue]]
The partnership was formed to publish the ''[[Massachusetts Spy]]'', and lasted for three months, after which Thomas continued publication alone. For the paper's motto, he chose “Open to all parties, but influenced by none.”&lt;ref name=acab&gt;{{Appletons'|wstitle=Thomas, Isaiah|year=1900|inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially it came out three times each week, then (under his sole ownership) as a semi-weekly, and beginning in 1771, as a weekly. The paper soon espoused the Whig cause and was the object of government efforts to suppress it.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} In 1771 Gov. [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] ordered the attorney general to prosecute Thomas, but the grand jury failed to find cause for indictment.&lt;ref name=acab/&gt;
In Boston, in 1774, Thomas published the ''[[Royal American Magazine]]'', which was continued for a short time by [[Joseph Greenleaf]], and which contained many engravings by [[Paul Revere]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
===Escape to Worcester===
Wary of the Tories' growing resentment of the independence of the ''Spy'', on April 16, 1775 (three days before the [[Battle of Concord]], in which he took part), Thomas took his presses from Boston and set them up in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]]. His other property was destroyed.&lt;ref name=acab/&gt;  In Worcester, he published and sold books, built a paper mill and bindery, and continued the paper until 1802 save for gaps in 1776–1778 and in 1786–1788. The ''Spy'' supported [[George Washington]] and the [[Federalist Party]]. He was also postmaster for a time.
Thomas married Mary Fowle, described as a &quot;half-cousin&quot;, on May 26, 1779.&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas Crawford McMurtrie|McMurtrie, Douglas C.]] ''The Book: The Story of Printing &amp; Bookmaking''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1943: 431.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1802, Thomas gave his Worcester business over to his son, including the control of the ''Spy''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
===Later life===
From 1775 until 1803, Thomas published the ''[[New England Almanac]]'', continued until 1819 by his son, Isaiah Thomas, Jr. It had something of the flavor of Benjamin Franklin's ''Poor Richard's Almanac''.&lt;ref name=acab/&gt; In 1786 he procured from Europe the first font of music type that was brought to the [[United States]], and he was the first printer in the U.S. to use such type. He was engaged at [[Walpole, New Hampshire]], in book publishing and printing the ''Farmer's Museum'', and in 1788 opened a bookstore in Boston under the firm name of Thomas and Andrews, also establishing branches of his publishing business in several parts of the United States. The monthly ''[[Massachusetts Magazine]]'' was published by the firm, with Ebenezer T. Andrews, in eight volumes, from 1789 until 1796. At Worcester he printed a folio edition of the [[Bible]] in 1791, [[Isaac Watts|Watts]]' ''Psalms and Hymns'', and most of the Bibles and school books that were used in the U.S. at that date.&lt;ref name=acab/&gt;{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
His ambition throughout his life was to write an extensive book on the history of publishing.
He began what would become ''[[History of Printing in America (book)|History of Printing in America]]'' in 1808.&lt;ref name=McMurtrie432&gt;[[Douglas Crawford McMurtrie|McMurtrie, Douglas C.]] ''The Book: The Story of Printing &amp; Bookmaking''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1943: 432.&lt;/ref&gt; Fully titled ''History of Printing in America, with a Biography of Printers, and an Account of Newspapers'', it was published in two volumes in 1810. A second edition, published in 1874, was prepared by his grandson Benjamin Franklin Thomas and included a catalog of American publications previous to 1776 and a memoir of Isaiah Thomas.
In November 1812, Thomas founded the American Society of Antiquaries, now known as the [[American Antiquarian Society]], partly to take care of the extensive library he had accumulated in preparing his history of publishing. At its first meeting, Thomas was elected president, a role he held until his death.&lt;ref name=McMurtrie432/&gt; In addition to nearly 8,000 volumes from his collection, he gave to its library tracts, and one of the most valuable files of newspapers in the country, and he presented land and a hall, with a provision equal to $24,000 for its maintenance.&lt;ref name=acab/&gt;
Thomas spent his final days in Worcester. Upon his death in 1831, he bequeathed his entire library, his collection of early American newspapers, as well as his personal papers and records to the American Antiquarian Society.&lt;ref name=McMurtrie432/&gt;
Thomas is now interred at [[Rural Cemetery (Worcester, Massachusetts)|Rural Cemetery]] in Worcester.&lt;ref&gt;{{FAG|5472|Isaiah Thomas, Sr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Legacy==
Thomas's grandson [[Benjamin Thomas (congressman)|B. F. Thomas]] noted his grandfather's importance in founding the American Antiquarian Society. &quot;He saw and understood, no man better, from what infinitely varied and minute sources the history of a nation's life was to be drawn; that the only safe rule was to gather up all the fragments so that nothing be lost.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas Crawford McMurtrie|McMurtrie, Douglas C.]] ''The Book: The Story of Printing &amp; Bookmaking''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1943: 434.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' created the Carey-Thomas Award for creative publishing, naming it honor of [[Mathew Carey]] and Isaiah Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,774310,00.html &quot;Publishers' Oscar&quot;]; ''Time'', February 15, 1943&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Farrow: &quot;I would always rush straight back to my room after lectures and meals so I could meditate.

The '''yellow mongoose''' (''Cynictis penicillata''), sometimes referred to as the '''red meerkat''', is a member of the [[mongoose]] family averaging about 1&amp;nbsp;lb (1/2&amp;nbsp;kg) in weight and about 20 in (500&amp;nbsp;mm) in length.&lt;ref name = MSW3&gt;{{MSW3 Carnivora | id = 14000508 | page = 564}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lives in open country, from [[semi-desert]] [[scrubland]] to [[grasslands]] in [[Angola]], [[Botswana]], [[South Africa]], [[Namibia]], and [[Zimbabwe]]. 
[[File:Yellow Mongoose Klipriviersberg Johannesburg.jpg|thumbnail|Yellow mongoose, Klipriviersberg, Johannesburg]]
==Taxonomy==
''Cynictis penicillata'' is the [[Monotypic taxon|only member]] of its [[genus]], but as many as twelve [[subspecies]] of yellow mongoose have been described. In general, the yellow mongoose has lighter highlights on the underbelly and chin, a bushy tail, and a complete lack of [[sexual dimorphism]]. Southern yellow mongooses are larger, have yellow or reddish fur, longer fur, and a longer [[tail]] with a characteristic white tip. Northern subspecies tend towards smaller size, grey colouration, a grey or darker grey tip to the tail, and shorter hair more appropriate to the hotter climate.
==Habits==
[[File:Fuchsmanguste 2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Yellow mongoose]]
The yellow mongoose is [[carnivore|carnivorous]], consuming mostly [[arthropod]]s but also other small mammals, [[lizard]]s, [[snake]]s and [[egg (biology)|eggs]] of all kinds.
The yellow mongoose is primarily [[diurnal animal|diurnal]], though [[nocturnal]] activity has been observed. Living in colonies of up to 20 individuals in a permanent underground [[burrow]] complex, the yellow mongoose will often co-exist with [[Cape ground squirrel]]s or [[suricate]]s and share maintenance of the warren, adding new tunnels and burrows as necessary. The tunnel system has many entrances, nearby which the yellow mongoose makes its [[latrine (animal)|latrine]]s.
==Social structure==
[[File:Cynictis penicillata, Lake District Wildlife Park.jpg|thumb|A yellow mongoose in Lake District Wildlife Park, Cumbria, northwestern England.]]
The [[Presociality|social structure]] of the yellow mongoose is [[hierarchy|hierarchical]], based around a central breeding pair and their most recent offspring. There are also subadults, the elderly, or adult relatives of the central pair. Male ranges tend to overlap, while females from other dens have contiguous non-overlapping ranges. Every day, the alpha male will mark members of his group with anal gland secretions, and his boundaries with facial and anal secretions, as well as urine. The alpha male also rubs his back against raised objects, leaving behind hair as a visual [[territorial marking|marker of territory]]. Other members of the group mark their dens with cheek secretions. A colony can have 20-40 members.
==Predators==
[[Predator]]s of the yellow mongoose are [[birds of prey]], [[snake]]s and [[jackal]]s. When frightened, the yellow mongoose will growl and secrete from its anal glands. It can also scream, bark, and purr, though these are exceptions, as the yellow mongoose is usually silent, and communicates mood and status through tail movements.
==Mating season==
[[File:Cynictis_penicillata_mating2.jpg|thumb|Yellow mongooses mating]]
The yellow mongoose's mating season is between July and September, and it gives birth underground between October and December, with no bedding material, in a clean chamber of the [[burrow]] system. Usually, two offspring are produced per pregnancy, and they are [[wean]]ed at 10 weeks, reaching adult size after 10 months.
==Rabies==
There is some concern about the role of ''Cynictis penicillata'' as a [[natural reservoir]] of [[rabies]]. Most African wild animals will die within several weeks of infection with rabies, but it seems that certain genetic strains of the yellow mongoose can carry it asymptomatically, but infectiously, for years.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid7777324&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Taylor PJ |title=A systematic and population genetic approach to the rabies problem in the yellow mongoose (Cynictis penicillata) |journal=Onderstepoort J.

'''''Airborne Ranger''''' is a [[video game]] developed and released by [[MicroProse]] in 1987 for the [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Commodore 64]], [[ZX Spectrum]], and [[MS-DOS]].  It is an [[action game]] in which a sole [[United States Army Rangers|U.S. Army Ranger]] is sent to infiltrate the enemy territory to complete various objectives. [[Amiga]] and [[Atari ST]] versions were released few years later and were a wholly independent development effort and different from gameplay standpoint.{{cn|date=December 2016}}
The game was followed by ''[[Special Forces (video game)|Special Forces]]'' in 1991.
==Gameplay==
The game consists of several missions, in which the player controls a sole Ranger whose objectives include killing an enemy officer, destroying an enemy [[bunker]], taking out a [[Surface-to-air missile|SAM]] site, and rescuing a captured POW, which would possibly free a roster member that was labeled P.O.W. The game creates the maps and objective locations randomly, so the player is required to plan each mission carefully, because no mission is the same.  
At the start of each mission, the player is presented with a short overview of the mission, and can select a Ranger from a roster of available soldiers. The player is then in control of an aircraft, described as a [[Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey|V-22 Osprey]] and is allowed to drop three [[ammunition|ammo]] crates over the enemy territory. Once the three containers are dropped, the Ranger is [[parachute]]d into the area. Upon touch-down, the player has to overcome several obstacles, including enemy soldiers and officers, [[land mine|mine fields]], [[Defensive fighting position|foxholes]] and bunkers. Due to limited ammunition, the player needs to plan his path through the territory. The dropped ammo crates provide the soldier with fresh [[hand grenade]]s and ammo. After completing the mission, the Ranger has to navigate to a pick-up point within a time limit. If the Ranger is captured (but not killed), the player can start an optional rescue mission using another soldier from the roster. Each successful mission increases the rank of the individual Ranger, up to [[colonel]].
==Manual==
The manual mimics a Field Manual&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/ US Field Manual Index]&lt;/ref&gt;  of the U.S. Army, and brings the number of code FM75-041, non-existent outside the fiction of the game. The manual includes 40 pages in black and white, plus the color cover of thin cardboard. It is divided into two parts with 11 chapters in all. In the second part talks about the true story of U.S.  Rangers from 1759 to the [[American Revolution]] to [[World War II]], the [[Korean War]], until today, with the [[Vietnam War]], the [[invasion of Grenada]] in 1983, their training and equipment, operations  mountains, desert and jungle, consisting of a paraglider, a Colt [[CAR-15]] rifle, on the hand fragmentation [[M26 grenade]], a grenade launcher [[M72 LAW]], the [[M18 Claymore anti-personnel mine]] and the ranger knife F7.  Aside from informational purposes, the manual was used as a form of copyright protection - each time you loaded the game it would give the player a multiple choice question on the identification of military ribbons, which were listed at the top of each page throughout the booklet.  If the player answered correctly, the game loaded.  If guessed incorrectly, the game wouldn't load.
==Reception==
A review in ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' felt ''Airborne Ranger'' was reminiscent of the earlier arcade game ''[[Commando (arcade game)|Commando]]'', but much deeper and more versatile. The graphics and sound were praised, noting gunfire sounds different when shot from inside fortifications than it does outside fortifications.&lt;ref name=&quot;CGW&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|date=January 1988|last=Rohrer|first=Kevin|periodical=[[Computer Gaming World]]|title=Airborne Ranger|pages=18|postscript =}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 1992 survey of computer wargames with modern settings gave the game four and a half stars out of five.&lt;ref name=&quot;brooks199206&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&amp;pub=2&amp;id=95 | title=The Modern Games: 1950 - 2000 | work=Computer Gaming World | date=June 1992 | accessdate=24 November 2013 | author=Brooks, M. Evan | pages=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also received 4½ out of 5 stars in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dragon135&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Role of Computers|last1=Lesser|last2=Lesser|last3=Lesser|first1=Hartley|first2=Patricia|first3=Kirk|journal=Dragon|issue=135|date=July 1988|pages=82–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[Compute!'s Gazette]]'' noted that ''Airborne Ranger'' was an unusual game for MicroProse's developers given their history of publishing simulations, writing &quot;they have created an arcade game, and a darned good one&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bobo198805&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1988-05-computegazette/Compute_Gazette_Issue_59_1988_May#page/n31/mode/2up | title=Airborne Ranger | work=Compute's Gazette | date=May 1988 | accessdate=6 October 2013 | author=Bobo, Ervin | pages=31-32}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Compute!]]'' stated that &quot;''Airborne Ranger'' is an excellent game from beginning to end&quot;, but cautioned that &quot;the violence and action are graphic and highly realistic&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bixby198805&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/1988-05-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_096_1988_May#page/n65/mode/2up | title=Airborne Ranger | work=Compute! | date=May 1988 | accessdate=10 November 2013 | author=Bixby, Robert | pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MISSIONNAIRES MORMONS.JPG|thumb|right|[[Missionary (LDS Church)#Companionships|Two missionaries]] of The Church of Jesus-Christ of Latter-day Saints]]
'''Missionaries of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints''' (LDS Church)—widely known as '''Mormon missionaries'''—are volunteer representatives of the LDS Church who engage variously in [[proselytizing]], church service, [[humanitarian aid]], and community service. Mormon missionaries may serve on a full- or part-time basis, depending on the assignment, and are organized geographically into [[Mission (LDS Church)|missions]]. The mission assignment could be to any one of the [[List of missions of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|418]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Statistics 2015&quot;&gt;[http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/2015-statistical-report-april-2016-general-conference &quot;2015 Statistical Report for 2016 April General Conference&quot;], ''Mormon Newsroom'', April 2, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; missions organized worldwide.
The LDS Church is one of the most active modern practitioners of [[missionary]] work, reporting that it had over 74,000 full-time missionaries worldwide at the end of 2015&lt;ref name=&quot;Statistics 2015&quot; /&gt; (as well as nearly 32,000 part-time church-service missionaries).&lt;ref name=&quot;Statistics 2015&quot; /&gt;  Most full-time Mormon missionaries are single young men and women in their late teens and early twenties and older couples no longer with children in the home. Missionaries are often assigned to serve far from their homes, including in other countries. Many missionaries learn a new language at a [[missionary training center]] as part of their assignment. Missions typically last two years for males, 18 months for females, and 6 to 18 months for older couples. The LDS Church strongly encourages, but does not require, missionary service for young men. All Mormon missionaries serve voluntarily and do not receive a salary for their work; they typically finance missions themselves or with assistance from family or other church members. Many Latter-day Saints save money during their teenage years to cover their mission expenses.
Throughout the [[History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|church's history]], over one million missionaries have been sent on missions.&lt;ref name = onemillion1&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/one-million-missionaries-thirteen-million-members |title= News Story {{ndash}} One Million Missionaries, Thirteen Million Members |work= Newsroom |publisher= LDS Church |date= June 25, 2007 |accessdate= 2012-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = onemillion2&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/680194052/1-million-missionaries-for-LDS-Church--so-far.html |title= 1 million missionaries for LDS Church – so far |last= Walch |first= Tad |newspaper= Deseret Morning News |date= June 26, 2007 |accessdate= 2012-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Significance and basic qualifications===
LDS Church [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|president]] [[Spencer W.

Hinckley]] had suggested that a mission is not to be a rite of passage,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/1990/09/news-of-the-church?lang=eng |title= News of the Church {{ndash}} New Mission Presidents Counseled to Love Their Missionaries and the People |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date=September 1990 |pages= 74–75 |first= LaRene |last= Gaunt |accessdate= 2012-11-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; this cultural aspect remains.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} With the usual starting age of 18–20, a mission provides a clear event or marker for the traditional age of adulthood, but is not necessary for continuance in church membership.
Young men between the ages of 18 and 25 who meet standards of worthiness are strongly encouraged to consider a two-year, full-time [[Proselytism|proselytizing]] mission. This expectation is based in part on the [[New Testament]] passage &quot;Go ye therefore, and teach all nations&quot; ([[s:Bible (King James)/Matthew#Chapter 28|Matt. 28: 19–20]]). The minimum age had previously been age 19 in most countries until October 6, 2012, when church president [[Thomas S. Monson]] announced that all male missionaries, regardless of nation, could serve from age 18.&lt;ref name= missionaryAge&gt;{{citation |title= News Release |work= Newsroom {{ndash}} Church Lowers Age Requirement for Missionary Service |url= http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/church-lowers-age-requirement-for-missionary-service |date= October 6, 2012 |publisher= LDS Church |accessdate= 2012-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the announcement, some countries held that male missionaries may be 18 years old because of educational or military requirements.&lt;ref name= youngmissionaries&gt;{{citation |last= Stack |first= Peggy Fletcher |title= Some Mormon men can go on missions at age 18 |url= http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/blogsfaithblog/52458313-180/mormon-mission-age-academy.html.csp |newspaper= [[The Salt Lake Tribune]] |date= August 25, 2011 |authorlink= Peggy Fletcher Stack |accessdate= 2012-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also announced that young women may serve beginning at age 19 instead of 21.&lt;ref name = missionaryAge/&gt;  In 2007, approximately 30% of all 19-year-old LDS men became Mormon missionaries; from LDS families that are active in the church, approximately 80–90% of 19-year-old men serve a mission.&lt;ref name= metamorphosis/&gt;
In cases where an immediate family member dies, the missionary has the choice to travel home for the funeral or to remain on the mission. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Missionaries can be sent home for violating mission rules, and occasionally missionaries choose to go home for health or various other reasons. However, the vast majority of missionaries serve the whole two-year (men) or eighteen-month (women) terms.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}
As of 2007, 80% of all Mormon missionaries were young, single men, 13% were young single women and 7% retired couples.&lt;ref name = metamorphosis/&gt; Women who would like to serve a mission must meet the same standards of worthiness and be at least 19 years old. Women generally serve as missionaries for 18 months. Married retired couples, on the other hand, are encouraged to serve missions, but their length of service may vary from 6 to 36 months depending on their circumstances and means.&lt;ref name= chasehall&gt;{{citation |first= Chase |last= Hall |url= http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/lifestyle/51975755-80/church-missionaries-senior-lds.html.csp |title= Shorter stints may draw more senior LDS missionaries |newspaper= [[Salt Lake Tribune]] |date= 2011-06-15 |accessdate= 2012-11-27 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Any single retired person may also be called to serve in what is known as ''senior missionary service''. In the last two decades, the LDS Church has stepped up its call for senior couple missionaries.
===Standards of worthiness===
All missionaries must meet certain minimum standards of worthiness. Among the standards that a prospective missionary must demonstrate adherence to are: regular attendance at [[Worship services of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|church meetings]], regular personal [[prayer]], regular study of the [[Standard Works|scriptures]], adherence to the [[law of chastity]] (sexual purity), adherence to the [[Word of Wisdom]] (code of health and nutrition), payment of [[tithe|tithing]], spiritual diligence and testimony of God.
===Other exclusionary factors===
In addition to spiritual preparedness, church [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishops]] are instructed to ensure that prospective missionaries are physically, mentally, and emotionally capable of full-time missionary work. In the same speech where he called for &quot;every young man&quot; to fill a mission, Kimball added, &quot;we realize that while all men definitely should, all men are not prepared to teach the gospel abroad.&quot;&lt;ref name=kimball /&gt; Apart from general issues of worthiness and ability, there are a number of specific situations that will disqualify a person from becoming a full-time missionary for the LDS Church. Those excluded include those who would have to leave dependent children in the care of someone else; young couples who are still of childbearing age; those who are in debt and have not made arrangements to meet these obligations; those who are on legal probation or parole; couples with serious unresolved marital problems; those who are HIV-positive; and those who have been convicted of sexual abuse. Additionally, members who have submitted to, performed, encouraged, paid for, or arranged for an abortion (except in the case of rape, incest, or the mothers life is in danger) are usually excluded from missionary service, as are members who have fathered or borne a child out of wedlock; men under 26 and women under 40 who have been divorced; and anyone who has participated in homosexual activity after age 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= [[Church Handbook of Instructions]], Book 1: Stake Presidencies and Bishoprics |location= Salt Lake City |publisher= LDS Church |year= 2006 |pages= 92–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
From the beginnings of the LDS Church, people of black African descent could be members of the church, but up until 1978 the LDS Church did not call men of black African descent to serve on missions, due to the [[Black people and Mormonism|ban on blacks holding the priesthood]]. The priesthood ban [[Official Declaration—2|was lifted]] during [[Spencer W. Kimball|Kimball's]] presidency and since 1978 there has been no restrictions to missionary service that are based on race or ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/topics/priesthood-ordination-before-1978?lang=eng |title= Study By Topic: Gospel Topics {{ndash}} Priesthood Ordination before 1978 |work= LDS.org |publisher= LDS Church |accessdate= 2012-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Mission call===
After application to the church and the requisite approval, prospective missionaries receive a &quot;call to serve&quot;—an official notification of their location assignment—through the mail from the [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|President of the Church]]. The mission call also informs the prospective missionary what language he or she will be expected to use during his or her mission. Members of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]] are responsible for assigning missionaries to a particular mission. A prospective missionary receiving the call to serve is generally considered to be a major event in LDS culture; family members, friends, and members of the prospective missionary's congregation often gather together when a call arrives, which the prospective missionary opens and reads aloud to the group.
===Temple attendance===
Before beginning their mission, prospective male missionaries are usually [[ordination|ordained]] to the office of an [[Elder (Mormonism)|elder]] in the [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek Priesthood]] (if they do not hold this office already). All missionaries are [[setting apart|set apart]] by the [[laying on of hands]] to preach the gospel; this is usually performed by the missionary's [[stake president]]. Prospective missionaries also usually attend the [[Temple (LDS Church)|temple]] for the first time to receive their [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|endowment]] if they have not already done so.
===Training===
[[File:Missionary training center provo ut.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Missionary Training Center]] in [[Provo, Utah|Provo]], [[Utah]], [[United States]], is one of 15 such centers located throughout the world.]]
[[File:MTC entrance.JPG|thumb|right|The Provo MTC is the LDS Church's largest [[Missionary Training Center]].]]
Newly called missionaries attend a short training period at one of 15 church [[Missionary Training Center]]s (MTCs) worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Scott |last= Taylor |date= March 23, 2011 |title= The 14 international Missionary Training Centers (MTCs) |url= http://www.deseretnews.com/top/131/0/The-14-international-Missionary-Training-Centers-MTCs.html |newspaper= [[Deseret News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest MTC is located in [[Provo, Utah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.mtc.byu.edu/themtc.htm |title= Missionary Training Center, Provo Utah {{ndash}} About the MTC |work= mtc.byu.edu |publisher= [[Brigham Young University]] |accessdate= 2012-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; adjacent to [[Brigham Young University]]. Missionaries who will not be learning a language in order to serve their missions spend three weeks at an MTC where they practice using proselytizing materials, learn expected conduct, and study the [[Standard Works|scriptures]]. Missionaries bound for foreign-language missions spend six to nine weeks at an MTC, depending on the language to be learned. During this period, they are encouraged not to speak in their native tongue but rather to immerse themselves in the new language.
==Missionary conduct==
===The Missionary Handbook===
The basic standards of missionary service and conduct are contained in the ''Missionary Handbook''.&lt;ref name=&quot;MissionaryHandbook&quot;&gt;{{citation |title= Missionary Handbook |url= https://missionary.lds.org/missionary/Missionary%20Handbook.pdf |publisher= LDS Church |year= 2006 |accessdate= 2012-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Missionaries are instructed that following these standards will protect them both physically and spiritually. Mission presidents have discretion to adjust some of the standards according to local circumstances.&lt;ref name=&quot;MissionaryHandbook&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1}} The ''Missionary Handbook'' is also commonly and informally referred to as &quot;the white handbook&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/52648912-78/missionaries-church-lds-missionary.html.csp?page=2 |title= Mormon missions: Did you know ... ? |newspaper= [[The Salt Lake Tribune]] |date= September 30, 2011 |accessdate= 2012-11-27}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
===Dress and grooming===
Previously, full-time LDS missionaries were required to adhere to a dress code: for men, conservative, dark trousers and suit coats, white dress shirts, and conservative ties. For women, modest and professional dresses or blouses and mid-calf length skirts were worn.
In recent years,{{When|date=December 2013}} the LDS Church has updated their grooming standards. Young men are no longer required to wear dark suits, and they do not have to wear a full suit during regular everyday proselyting activities. They must, however, remain in professional, conservative attire. For instance, a light colored suit is acceptable. They are also allowed to wear a sweater or suit vest over their dress shirt and are encouraged to wear colored ties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://missionary.lds.org/dress-grooming/elder/guidelines/ &quot;Missionary: Dress and Grooming: Elders: General Guidelines&quot;], lds.org.&lt;/ref&gt;
Sister missionaries may wear skirts and dresses that cover their knees. In areas infested with mosquitoes, particularly in [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]] where the humidity yields infestations, sister missionaries are now permitted to wear slacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/missionary-dress-guidelines-revised-help-prevent-mosquito-borne-diseases Missionary Dress Guidelines Revised to Help Prevent Mosquito-Borne Diseases], ''Mormon Newsroom'', 20 May 2016. Retrieved 20 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Young women are encouraged to dress in colors and patterns, and they may wear appropriate jewelry and accessories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://missionary.lds.org/dress-grooming/sister/guidelines/ &quot;Missionary: Dress and Grooming: Sisters: General Guidelines&quot;], lds.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

They are both carrying backpacks and wearing white dress shirts, ties and slacks. The one on the right is wearing a short-sleeved shirt and tan slacks]]
In some areas these standards are altered slightly according to the discretion of the [[mission president]]. For example, in hot, humid climates, suit coats are not required, and dress shirts may be short-sleeved. Casual clothes may be worn only in limited circumstances, such as when missionaries provide manual labor or exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Missionary Handbook|url=http://missionary.lds.org/missionary/Missionary%20Handbook.pdf|publisher=LDS Church|accessdate=5 June 2014|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2016, the dress guidelines were updated to allow for &quot;simple and conservative&quot; sunglasses and &quot;wide-brimmed hats&quot; as part of a missionary's attire to provide missionaries protection from excessive heat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865654548/Updated-LDS-missionary-dress-and-grooming-guidelines-allow-for-sunglasses.html &quot;Updated LDS Missionary dress and grooming guidelines allow for sunglasses&quot;], ''[[Deseret News]]'', 18 May 2016. Retrieved 19 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
All full-time missionaries wear a name tag that gives their surname with the appropriate title (&quot;Elder&quot; or &quot;Sister&quot; in English-speaking areas, or their equivalent titles in other languages). The name tag also bears the church's name, unless the mission president considers this inadvisable due to circumstances in the area (e.g., adverse political conditions). Missionaries are required to wear the tag at all times in public.{{Update|date=December 2013}}
===Companionships===
A ''missionary companionship'', consisting of two (or occasionally, three) missionaries, is the smallest organizational unit of a mission. Every missionary is assigned by the [[mission president]] to be another missionary's ''companion''. Missionary companionships are generally maintained for months at a time and most missionaries will have served with multiple companions by the end of their mission. These companions very rarely have prior acquaintance outside of the mission. Companionships are always of the same gender.
Missionary companions are instructed to stay together at all times and not to go out of the hearing of their companion's voice.&lt;ref name=&quot;MissionaryHandbook&quot;/&gt;{{rp|30–31}} Privacy is allowed only for personal care such as showering. One of the intentions of this strict policy of staying together is to discourage missionaries from breaking any mission rules.&lt;ref name=&quot;MissionaryHandbook&quot;/&gt;{{rp|31}} Companions share the same living quarters and the same bedroom, but not the same bed.&lt;ref name=&quot;MissionaryHandbook&quot;/&gt;{{rp|31}}
When companions have conflicting personalities or interests, they are encouraged to try to resolve them themselves. If a missionary's companion is having difficulty with the work or with personal problems missionaries are instructed to give criticism constructively, in private and with respect.&lt;ref name=&quot;MissionaryHandbook&quot;/&gt;{{rp|30}} In dealing with a problem missionaries are first to raise the issue with their companion and if it is not resolved to raise it with the mission president. &quot;A missionary's first priority is to the Lord, then to the mission president and finally to their companion&quot;, as the missionary handbook states.&lt;ref name=&quot;MissionaryHandbook&quot;/&gt;{{rp|32}} High value is placed on the spiritual commitment to the virtues of humility and love. Missionaries are urged to treat the companionship as a relationship that must succeed in being cooperative and selfless, thus improving the spirituality, character and social skills of each individual missionary.
===Senior couples===
Senior couples serve as a companionship for the entirety of their mission and have more relaxed rules. Unlike single missionaries, they share the same bed and are able to travel outside of the mission boundaries.
===Personal relationships===
Missionaries are encouraged to write a letter to their parents weekly. Since almost all of their time is otherwise occupied, other communication is limited. However, a missionary may use preparation day to correspond with any person that is resident outside of the boundaries of the mission. Missionaries do not go on vacation and are generally permitted to telephone their parents only on Christmas Day, and one other day of the year, usually [[Mother's Day]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MissionaryHandbook&quot;/&gt;{{rp|37}} Missionaries are provided with a free, filtered church e-mail account to correspond with their parents on preparation day only by using a computer in a public location, such as at a [[public library]] or an [[internet café]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MissionaryHandbook&quot;/&gt;{{rp|20}} In the event of an emergency, family members of a missionary may contact him or her via the mission president's office.
Single missionaries are prohibited from dating or courting while serving missions. The policy of companionships staying together at all times serves to discourage these activities. While missionaries may interact with members of the opposite sex, they may never be alone with them or engage in any kind of intimate physical or emotional activity (e.g., kissing, hugging, holding hands, flirting). They may not telephone, write, e-mail, or accept letters from members of the opposite sex that live in the area where they are assigned to proselyte.&lt;ref name=&quot;MissionaryHandbook&quot;/&gt;{{rp|33}} Missionary companionships are also asked not to visit with members of the opposite sex unless at least one person of the missionaries' same sex is present to chaperone.&lt;ref name=&quot;MissionaryHandbook&quot;/&gt;{{rp|34}} Alternatively, those contacts may be referred to a companionship of the same gender as the contact or to married couple missionaries, when available.
In the early days of the LDS Church, men were called to serve missions regardless of marital status. Today, however, married young men are not expected to serve missions, unless called to oversee a mission as a [[mission president]]. A call to be a mission president is typically extended to the married couple, and in turn, the entire family of the chosen mission president. Older retired couples also may serve as missionaries, but do not take their families with them.

Generally, missionaries wake up at 6:30&amp;nbsp;am.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/topic/missionary-program|title=Mormon Missionary Program - Missionaries Serve Two Year Missions|date=July 15, 2014|publisher=|accessdate=February 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After praying, exercising (30 minutes), and eating breakfast, they spend two hours studying the scriptures and other materials. If they are teaching in a foreign language, they'll spend another 30 minutes to an hour studying the language. Missionaries leave their place of residence at 10&amp;nbsp;am to proselytize (or 10:30&amp;nbsp;am or 11&amp;nbsp;am if teaching in a foreign language). They have an hour for lunch and dinner, and return to their apartment by 9&amp;nbsp;pm, or 9:30 if they are in the process of teaching a lesson at the end of the day. They plan for the next day's activities, pray, and are encouraged to write in their personal journal, but are not required to. They then retire to bed at 10:30&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref name=&quot;MissionaryHandbook&quot;/&gt;{{rp|14–15}}&lt;ref name=&quot;HandbookOnline&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/manual/missionary-handbook/missionary-conduct?lang=eng|title=Missionary Handbook Missionary Conduct|publisher=|accessdate=February 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Preach My Gospel&quot; /&gt;
On January 25, 2017, the church announced that schedules can be modified depending on the area in which missionaries serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/more-flexibility-announced-mormon-missionary-schedules |title=More Flexibility Announced for Mormon Missionary Daily Schedules |date=January 25, 2017 |website=Mormon Newsroom |publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |language=English |access-date=January 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Media rules===
Missionaries are admonished to &quot;avoid all forms of worldly entertainment.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MissionaryHandbook&quot;/&gt;{{rp|24}} Generally, they are not permitted to watch television, listen to the radio, watch or go to movies, or use the Internet&lt;ref name=&quot;MissionaryHandbook&quot;/&gt;{{rp|25}} (except to use email, and [[social media]] for their work, see [[#Personal relationships|Personal relationships]] above). They are not permitted to listen to music that has romantic lyrics or overtones, or merely entertains.&lt;ref name=&quot;MissionaryHandbook&quot;/&gt;{{rp|25}} The general interpretation of this guideline is to listen to only religious music, such as that performed by the [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]], though the rule's application has been variable in some missions. They are only permitted to read books, magazines, or other materials authorized by the church.&lt;ref name=&quot;MissionaryHandbook&quot;/&gt;{{rp|27}}
===Slang===
Missionaries are instructed to avoid slang and casual language including when they are alone in their apartment and in their letters to family.&lt;ref name=&quot;MissionaryHandbook&quot;/&gt;{{rp|8–9}} They are also instructed to refer to missionary leaders only by their correct titles.&lt;ref name=&quot;MissionaryHandbook&quot;/&gt;{{rp|9}} However, as with the members of any organization, some missionaries use certain missionary-specific jargon when communicating with one another. Some words and expressions are mission- or language-specific, while others are universal, such as calling the halfway point of a mission the &quot;hump&quot; or [[hump day]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Paul B. |last= Skousen |authorlink= Paul Skousen |title= Brother Paul's Mormon Bathroom Reader |location= Springville, Utah |publisher= Cedar Fort |isbn= 1-55517-895-2 |page= 359}}&lt;/ref&gt; or describing a missionary who is excited about returning home as &quot;trunky&quot; as he has already packed his [[trunk (luggage)|trunk]].{{r|smout1988}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Worthy2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Worthy |first= Jack B.

==Number of missionaries and number of converts==

[[File:Ratio of Converts Baptized to Full-Time Missionaries.jpg|thumb|right|490px|Ratio of Converts Baptized to Full-Time Missionaries, 1971–2010]]
As of the end of 2015, there were over 74,000 LDS missionaries serving in 418 [[Mission (LDS Church)|church missions]] throughout the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Statistics 2015&quot; /&gt; Their work, often in cooperation with local members, resulted in 257,402 convert [[Baptism (Latter Day Saints)|baptisms]] in 2015.&lt;ref name=&quot;Statistics 2015&quot; /&gt; Author David Stewart points out that the number of convert baptisms per missionary per year has fallen from a high of 8.03 in 1989 to just 4.67 in 2005.&lt;ref name= Stewart&gt;{{citation |last= Stewart |first= David G., Jr. |year= 2007 |title= The Law Of The Harvest: Practical Principles of Effective Missionary Work |location= Henderson, NV |publisher= Cumorah Foundation |isbn= 0-9795121-0-7 |oclc= 144460788}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the number of converts would increase if Mormon missionaries made greater efforts in meeting new people; he points out that the average pair of missionaries spends only four or five hours per week attempting to meet new people.&lt;ref name= Stewart/&gt;
==Types of missionaries==
===Proselyting===
The most visible and most common type of missionaries are typically those who [[proselytism|proselyte]] door-to-door and ride bicycles for transportation. For many years, Mormon missionaries used structured lessons called &quot;missionary discussions&quot; (formally called &quot;The Uniform System for Teaching the Gospel&quot;) to teach interested non-members and recent converts about the doctrines of the LDS Church and to commit them on the steps to take to become a member of the church. Missionaries were often instructed to adhere very closely to the six lessons, and they frequently quoted segments word-for-word (an especially helpful practice when learning a foreign language). The training materials also instructed missionaries to freely change the order of the lessons segments according to the needs and questions of the learners.
The missionary discussions were replaced beginning in October 2004 by a guide called ''Preach My Gospel'' which places emphasis on &quot;teaching by the Spirit&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Doctrine &amp; Covenants|dc|50|14}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mormons, &quot;teaching by the Spirit&quot; means seeking guidance from the Holy Ghost to teach; the idea is that the teachings will be catered to each person who is seeking the truth through divine guidance. According to ''Preach My Gospel'', God knows each of His children and can guide His servants to say and teach what is best for each individual.&lt;ref name=&quot;Preach My Gospel&quot;&gt;{{citation |title= Preach My Gospel |year= 2004 |publisher= LDS Church |url= http://www.lds.org/languages/additionalmanuals/preachgospel/PreachMyGospel___00_00_Complete__36617_eng_.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|89–90}}
Despite the latitude given to missionaries, the guide still contains material which should be actively taught. Chapter 3 of ''Preach My Gospel'' concisely describes all of the doctrine that the missionaries are to teach to those learning about the church. The missionaries are responsible for knowing the doctrine and continually preparing to teach it. They can choose the order that this material is taught to serve the needs of each individual. This is a change from the missionary discussions which were usually taught in order to each investigator.
The book, now published in many languages,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/2007/11/preach-my-gospel-the-unifying-tool-between-members-and-missionaries?lang=eng |title= Preach My Gospel—the Unifying Tool between Members and Missionaries |authorlink= Erich W. Kopischke |first= Erich W. |last= Kopischke |date=November 2007 |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; is meant to be used by the general church membership. This sets it apart from the previous missionary discussions, which were used primarily by full-time missionaries, members with church [[calling (Mormonism)|callings]] related to missionary work, and those preparing to serve missions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}
====Online====
According to ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', the church has online missionaries, who work at a Referral Center Mission in [[Provo, Utah]].&lt;ref name=&quot;huffingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/09/mormon-church-online_n_5024251.html|title=Hook Of Mormon: Inside The Church's Online-Only Missionary Army|first1=Bianca Bosker Executive Tech|last1=Editor|first2=The Huffington|last2=Post|date=April 9, 2014|publisher=|accessdate=February 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These missionaries use the &quot;Chat with a Mormon&quot; homepage to talk with potential converts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mormon.org|title=Mormon.org - What is the Mormon Church and Religion?|publisher=|accessdate=February 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Salt Lake Tribune]]'' reported that these missionaries are more successful than traditional proselytizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/blogsfaithblog/57797283-180/online-missionaries-missionary-mormon.html.csp|title=Online Mormon missionaries outperform traditional proselytizers|first=The Salt Lake|last=Tribune|publisher=|accessdate=February 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, ''The Huffington Post'' also reported that it is now permissible for missionaries to use [[SMS]], [[blogs]] and [[Facebook]].&lt;ref name=&quot;huffingtonpost.com&quot;/&gt;
===Church-service===
[[File:COUPLE MISSIONNAIRE GENEALOGIE.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[Family History Center (LDS Church)|family history]] missionary couple]]
Missionaries with special needs or health considerations may be called as full-time or part-time service missionaries. Many fully able missionaries are called to do genealogical research or act as tour guides or hosts at [[Temple Square]] or [[Family History Library|Family History libraries]] and other church sites. In many areas, even proselytizing missionaries spend most of their day responding to incoming phone calls and queries, delivering requested media from the church's television and radio commercials. Missionaries may use [[public transit|public transportation]], [[walk]], bicycle, or in some areas drive automobiles owned by the church, or occasionally ride within a private automobile with a church member who is accompanying them to a teaching appointment, proselyting, or [[wikt:fellowshipping|fellowshipping]] activity. At the end of 2015, there were nearly 32,000 church-service missionaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Statistics 2015&quot; /&gt;
===Humanitarian aid===
The LDS Church also has a strong welfare and humanitarian missionary program. These [[Humanitarian Services|humanitarian missionaries]] typically serve in impoverished areas of the world and do not actively proselytize. Humanitarian missionaries comply with any local laws regarding teaching or displaying religious symbols, including the identifying name tags. This allows them to provide services and aid in countries where activities by religious organizations are typically restricted or forbidden, such as in predominantly Muslim countries or in Southeast Asia. Regular proselytizing missionaries are asked to engage in welfare activities and [[community service]], limited to four hours a week on days other than weekends or preparation day.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Florence|first= Giles H., Jr. |title= Called to Serve |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |page= 13 |date=September 1991 |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/1991/09/called-to-serve?lang=eng |accessdate= 2012-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Building missionaries were called by the president of the Tongan Mission in the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |authorlink= R. Lanier Britsch |first= R. Lanier |last= Britsch |title= The Church in the South Pacific |journal= Ensign |date=February 1976 |page= 19 |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/1976/02/the-church-in-the-south-pacific?lang=eng |accessdate= 2012-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among their major successes was building [[Liahona High School]]. From 1955 on, [[Wendell B. Mendenhall]] institutionalized building missionaries on a larger scale with skilled tradesmen called as supervisors of the missionaries. Most of the supervisors were Americans, while most of the workers were young men indigenous to the areas of the South Pacific and Latin America where the work was carried out. However, at times the situation was more complex. One example is Jose Alvarez, who was a native of Argentina, but had lived in the United States for three years when he was called to go with his family to Chile, where he served as a building missionary supervisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |newspaper=[[Church News]] |date= May 12, 2007 |first= John L. |last= Hart |title= 'Always together' — Church, couple matured together: Elder Claudio Zivic always willing to 'go and do' duty |url= http://www.ldschurchnewsarchive.com/articles/50573/Always-together--Church-couple-matured-together.html |accessdate= 2012-11-27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Often, trainee or assistant building supervisors would work under the leadership of an experienced supervisor in preparation for an assignment as a fully-fledged supervisor of some project or group of missionaries.
==Administration==
===Organization===
{{Main|Mission (LDS Church)}}
Every part of the world is assigned to be within a ''mission'' of the church, whether or not LDS missionaries are active in the area. An adult male [[mission president]] presides over the missionaries in the mission.
Most missions are divided into several ''zones'', a zone being a geographic area specified by the mission president (though these are often the same area as the LDS ecclesiastical unit known as a &quot;stake&quot;). A zone encompasses several more organizational units called ''districts''. Each zone and district is presided over by leaders drawn from male missionaries serving in that area. Zone and district leaders are responsible for gathering weekly statistics, assisting missionaries in their areas of responsibility, and general accountability to the mission president for the well-being and progress of the missionaries under their stewardship. A district typically encompasses four to eight missionaries, and may or may not comprise more than one proselytizing area. An ''area'' is typically a portion of the LDS ecclesiastical unit known as a ward (or congregation), one ward, or multiple wards.
In addition to the leaders mentioned above, the mission president has two or more assistants. Assistants to the President (APs) are typically missionaries who have previously served as district and/or zone leaders. They serve as the president's executive assistants, administering policies and helping missionaries throughout the mission.
===Expenses===
{{see also|Davis v. United States (1990)}}
Missionaries are expected to pay their own expenses while on the mission, often with assistance from family. In the past, each missionary paid his or her actual living expenses, but this approach created a disproportionate burden on missionaries who were assigned to more expensive areas of the world. In 1990, a new program was introduced to equalize the financial responsibility for each missionary and his or her family. Now, all young missionaries pay a flat monthly rate which is then redistributed according to regional costs of living. The cost of a mission varies based on the country of origin of the missionary; for missionaries from the United States, the cost is US$400 per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bolingbroke|first1=Bruce|title=Benefits of equal costs for LDS missions|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865625380/Benefits-of-equal-costs-for-LDS-missions.html?pg=all|accessdate=30 March 2016|publisher=Deseret News|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Peggy Fletcher Stack]], [http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/blogsfaithblog/56404563-180/church-lds-missionaries-missionary.html.csp &quot;Rising Mormon missionary numbers spur call for more donations&quot;], ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'', 3 June 2013. The cost can vary dramatically based on the country of origin. For instance, in Oceania, missionaries from Australia pay AU$395 and missionaries from New Zealand pay NZ$400, while missionaries from American Samoa pay US$85 and missionaries from Kiribati pay AU$20. Missionaries from Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu are exempt from making any payment: Pacific Area Presidency, &quot;Financing Full-time Missionary Service&quot; (letter to Area Seventies, Stake, Mission, and District Presidents; Bishops and Branch Presidents), 28 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The monthly rate helps to cover food, lodging, transportation, and other mission related expenses. Missionaries are asked to bring extra personal money for any personal items they would like to purchase. Once the money is received by the church it is then redistributed to the missionaries in amounts proportionate to the cost of living within the assigned mission area. {{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} As families now contribute to a general fund for missionary expenses, the sum is deductible under many nations' tax policies regarding charitable gifts.
For health care, the church provides missionaries with limited medical care. A missionary will be required to pay for any medical treatment that is considered non-essential or that is considered to be associated with a preexisting condition. The local mission office will often help missionaries find Mormon doctors or dentists who can offer their services to missionaries for a small fee or for free.
Young people in the church are encouraged to save money throughout their childhood and teenage years to pay for as much of their mission as they can, although many receive assistance from parents, family, or friends. Missionaries who cannot save the required funds may obtain assistance from their home [[Ward (LDS Church)|congregation]] or from a general missionary fund operated by the church and contributed to by Latter-day Saints around the world. Married couple missionaries are expected to pay their own costs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/csm/faq.pdf |title=FAQ: Mission and Service Opportunities for Senior Adults and Recommended Young Adults |publisher=LDS Church |format=PDF |accessdate=November 12, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029040248/http://www.lds.org/csm/faq.pdf |archivedate=October 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but in 2011 the church began paying for missionary couples' housing expenses that exceed US$1400 per month.&lt;ref name= chasehall/&gt; In many areas, church members often invite locally assigned missionaries over for meals to help reduce the overall expenditures of the missionary program.

A returned missionary (often abbreviated &quot;RM&quot;) is a term used by members of the LDS Church to refer to men and women who have previously served as Mormon missionaries. Once they return home, RMs are generally encouraged to begin dating seriously and to seek marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[[Spencer W. Kimball]], [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1975/02/the-marriage-decision “The Marriage Decision,”] ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', February 1975, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ezra Taft Benson]], [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1988/05/to-the-single-adult-brethren-of-the-church “To the Single Adult Brethren of the Church,”] ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', May 1988, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Earl C.

In Mormon culture, stereotypes and jokes abound regarding newly returned missionaries, most dealing with their difficulties in handling the reverse culture shock. Other stereotypes revolve around the fact that as missionaries, they lived highly structured, disciplined lives and avoided contact with members of the opposite sex, so many RMs have difficulty readjusting to social life and dating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightplanet.com/mormons/daily/missionary/index.htm |title=Mormon Missionary Work |publisher=Lightplanet.com |accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other stereotypes include the supposed rush of many RMs to get married as soon as possible. Many families whose daughters are old enough to marry encourage them to date RMs.
Returned missionaries are frequently called to assist in the local missionary effort and are encouraged to stay active within the LDS Church through callings and service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lds.about.com/od/mormonmissionaries |title=Mormon Missionaries |publisher=Lds.about.com |date=May 20, 2011 |accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; RMs who served in the same mission frequently stay in touch and often gather for mission reunions in Utah to coincide with the semiannual [[LDS General Conference]].&lt;ref name=&quot;desnewsreunions&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.deseretnews.com/reunions/s-list/1,2505,A,00.html | title=Current LDS mission reunion information | publisher=Deseret News | accessdate=October 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Mormons visit a country carpenter.jpg|thumb|left|&quot;Mormons visit a country carpenter&quot; (1856) by [[Christen Dalsgaard]], depicting a mid-19th century visit of a missionary to a Danish carpenter's workshop. The first missionaries arrived in Denmark in 1850.]]

The LDS Church regards [[Samuel H. Smith (Latter Day Saints)|Samuel H. Smith]], the younger brother of church founder [[Joseph Smith]], as the church's first full-time missionary.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan Carr, [http://lds.org/liahona/2004/09/the-first-latter-day-missionary &quot;The First Latter-day Missionary&quot;], ''[[Liahona (magazine)|Liahona]]'', Sep. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karianne Salisbury, [http://www.lds.org/liahona/2008/09/news-of-the-church/first-latter-day-saint-missionary-samuel-smith-born-200-years-ago &quot;News of the Church: First Latter-day Saint Missionary, Samuel Smith, Born 200 Years Ago&quot;], ''[[Liahona (magazine)|Liahona]]'', Sep. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith traveled from city to city, covering more than 4,000 miles, trying to sell copies of the [[Book of Mormon]]. The book was presented as evidence of Joseph Smith's prophetic calling. [[Phineas Young]] received a Book of Mormon from Samuel Smith and became an early member of the church. (Phineas' younger brother [[Brigham Young|Brigham]] would later be baptized and become the 2nd president of the LDS Church.)
During the 1850s missionaries were sent to Chile, France, Germany, Hawaii, India, Italy, Scandinavia, Switzerland and a number of other countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;mormonnewsroom.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Missionary Work in the Church|url=http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/history-of-missionary-work-in-the-church|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1898, the church began allowing single women to be called as missionaries. The first two single female missionaries were [[Jennie Brimhall]] and [[Inez Knight]], who were called to serve as companions in England.&lt;ref name = mangum&gt;Diane L. Mangum, [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1980/07/the-first-sister-missionaries &quot;The First Sister Missionaries&quot;], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', July 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;
Each mission was responsible for individually developing lessons until 1952 when, under the direction of [[Gordon B. Hinkley]], the church published &quot;A Systematic Program for Teaching the Gospel&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duffy|first1=John-Charles|title=The New Missionary Discussions and the Future of Correlation|journal=Sunstone|url=https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/pdf/138-28-46.pdf|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, towards the beginning of the church's [[Priesthood Correlation Program|correlation]] effort, &quot;A Uniform System for Teaching Investigators&quot; was made mandatory church-wide. The missionary lessons, or discussions as they were often called, continued to be updated with major revisions approximately every decade up until the publication of ''Preach My Gospel'' in 2004. Early missionaries, like Samuel Smith, relied primarily on the story of the Book of Mormon to attract converts to the church. By the late 19th century, the story of Joseph Smith's first vision had gained prominence and was given an important role in the official missionary lessons.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Historians have pondered the various phrases of this vision's evolution and tend to see its present form as a 'late development,' only gaining an influential status in LDS self-reflection late in the nineteenth century.&quot; {{citation |first=Douglas J. |last=Davies |title=An Introduction to Mormonism |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |page=136}}; {{harvnb|Widmer|2000|pp=92–107}}; {{harvnb|Shipps|1985|pp=30–32}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the early 1950s, [[Henry D. Moyle]] had responsibility over the missionary department. Moyle encouraged missionaries to use a tactic that later became known as &quot;baseball baptism&quot;. Missionaries 
would encourage young men to join church-sponsored sports leagues and baptism was imposed as a prerequisite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quinn|first1=D. Michael|title=The Mormon 'Baseball Baptism' Era|url=http://mormonstories.org/baseballbaptisms.html|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of this tactic created a large number of converts, especially in England, but very few of the young men ever had any interest in the spiritual aspects of the church. Moyle introduced baptism goals, missionary incentives and other salesmanship techniques into the church missionary department. [[David O. McKay]] eventually removed Moyle from his responsibilities over the missionary program but many of the changes introduced during this time remain even today.
During the 1960s, missionaries whose area of service required them to learn a new language were first sent to the Language Training Mission on the [[BYU]] campus. This later became the [[Missionary Training Center]] in 1978 where all new missionaries were sent for training not just the ones learning a language.
Starting during [[Spencer W. Kimball]]'s administration, it was emphasized that &quot;every able, worthy young man&quot; had a duty to serve a mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;mormonnewsroom.org&quot;/&gt; Prior to this, missionary service for men was not viewed as obligatory. This resulted in an increase in the number of young men choosing to serve missions.
Before [[1978 Revelation on Priesthood|1978]], the church did not permit people of African descent to hold the priesthood, and they were not actively proselytized. Missionary work in places such as [[Brazil]] may have increased pressure to change the policy due to the difficulty of verifying lack of African descent in these populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kimball|first1=Edward|title=Spencer W. Kimball and the Revelation on Priesthood|accessdate=20 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the policy was eliminated by Kimball, additional areas of the world were opened up to missionary work.
Church researchers discovered that in addition to the content of the lessons, the way in which the material was presented had a major impact on conversion. In 1984, the Missionary Department codified the &quot;commitment pattern&quot; as the proper way for missionaries to teach the lessons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shepherd|first1=Gordon|last2=Shepherd|first2=Gary|title=Membership Growth, Church Activity, and Missionary Recruitment|journal=Dialogue|url=https://dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V29N01_39.pdf|accessdate=23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This involves the missionaries making specific invitations to act in response to the lessons. Gospel students would be encouraged to make personal commitments to attend church, to read the Book of Mormon and to be baptized.
In 2002, apostle [[M. Russell Ballard]] delivered a [[General Conference (LDS Church)|General Conference]] address stating that the bar to qualify for missionary service had been raised and that &quot;the day of the 'repent and go' missionary is over&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ballard&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/general-conference/2002/10/the-greatest-generation-of-missionaries|title=The Greatest Generation of Missionaries|last=Ballard|first=M. Russell|date=October 2002|publisher=LDS Church|accessdate=March 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the church's October 2012 General Conference, church president [[Thomas S. Monson]] announced that the minimum age for missionary service for young men had been lowered from 19 to 18 and that the minimum age for young women had been lowered from 21 to 19.&lt;ref name = missionaryAge/&gt; Immediately following the announcement, the church experienced an unprecedented influx of new missionaries. The rate of new missionaries swelled &quot;by 471 percent, from about 700 new applications per week to about 4,000 each week, with young women comprising more than half of the new applicants.&quot; Later, the number of missionaries applying to serve slowed, but it is still double what it had been in the past and now the applicants are split somewhat evenly among young women and young men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865570142/ |title=Numbers of new LDS missionaries 'unprecedented,' church says |last1=Walker |first1=Joseph |last2= |first2= |date=January 7, 2013 |website= |publisher=''[[Deseret News]]'' |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the number of missionaries peaked at 89,000&lt;ref name=&quot;New Missions for 2015&quot;&gt;{{citation |first= R.

===Incidents===
[[File:JBBall Gravestone.jpg|thumb|Headstone of a missionary that was murdered by the [[Zarate Willka Armed Forces of Liberation]] while serving in Bolivia.{{r|jacobsenwells19890525}}]]
Although rare, missionaries have been the victims of violence. In 1974, two young-adult male missionaries were murdered in [[Austin, Texas]] by [[Robert Elmer Kleason]]. In 1977, the [[Mormon sex in chains case|case]] of a Mormon missionary who said he was abducted and raped by a woman was covered extensively by newspapers in Britain, being dubbed the [[Mormon sex in chains case]].&lt;ref&gt;Delano, Anthony (1978). ''Joyce McKinney and the Manacled Mormon''. Mirror Books. ISBN 978-0-85939-140-5.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, the [[Zarate Willka Armed Forces of Liberation]] killed two American missionaries in Bolivia.&lt;ref name=jacobsenwells19890525&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/print/48103/2-LDS-MISSIONARIES-ASSASSINATED-IN-BOLIVIA-TERRORISTS-CLAIM-RESPONSIBILITY-FOR-POLITICALLY-MOTIVATED.html | title=2 LDS Missionaries Assassinated in Bolivia / Terrorists Claim Responsibility for Politically Motivated Killing | work=The Deseret News | date=May 25, 1989 | accessdate=November 28, 2011 |author1=Jacobsen-Wells, JoAnn |author2=Spangler, Jerry }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1999 to 2006, three LDS missionaries were murdered worldwide, while 22 died in accidents of some sort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,180413,00.html Mormon Missionary Shot Dead in Virginia] from ''[[Fox News]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, three men from [[Port Shepstone]], South Africa were convicted of [[rape|raping]] and [[robbery|robbing]] two female LDS missionaries in June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news24.com/World/News/Missionary-rapists-jailed-20080125 &quot;Missionaries' rapists convicted&quot;], ''[[Pretoria News]]'', 2008-01-24.&lt;/ref&gt;
A few cases of kidnapping have also occurred, a recent one being in 1998, when two male missionaries were abducted while working in the [[Samara Oblast|Samara]] region of Russia. The kidnappers demanded US$300,000 for their return. The missionaries were released unharmed a few days later without payment of the ransom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/68320.stm Kidnapped Mormons freed] from the ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt; 
In August 2006, three male missionaries from Idaho, Nevada and California participated in the vandalism of a Roman Catholic shrine in [[San Luis, Colorado]], for which desecration the LDS Church apologized shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wnd.com/2008/03/59802/ Vandalism case against Mormons dropped: Catholic bishop urges Christian forgiveness for desecration of shrine] from [[WorldNetDaily]]&lt;/ref&gt; The incident recalled a 1972 occurrence in which a pair of missionaries in Thailand took pictures of themselves sitting on an ancient [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] statue. Although the missionaries &quot;probably didn't think much about it&quot;,&lt;ref name = byugaffe/&gt; they were caught and sentenced to a year in prison, and their images were published in the newspapers. The [[Bhumibol Adulyadej|King of Thailand]] pardoned them on his birthday, and they were released after six months. Missionaries of the church are counseled to respect other religions and cultures, one reason being to avoid such conflicts.&lt;ref name = byugaffe&gt;[http://newsnet.byu.edu/story.cfm/68043 Proselytizing History Repeats with Recent Missionary Gaffe] from ''BYU NewsNet''&lt;/ref&gt;
==In popular culture==
Mormon missionaries have been portrayed in various popular culture media. Missionaries are the main focus of [[LDS cinema]] films ''[[God's Army (motion picture)|God's Army]]'' (1999), ''[[The Other Side of Heaven]]'' (2001), ''[[The Best Two Years]]'' (2003), ''[[The R.M.]]'' (2003), ''[[God's Army 2|God's Army 2: States of Grace]]'' (2005), ''[[Return with Honor (2007)|Return with Honor]]'' (2007), ''[[The Errand of Angels]]'' (2008) and ''[[The Saratov Approach]]'' (2013). The musical ''[[Saturday's Warrior]]'' (1973) features missionaries and was made into a film in 1989. The DVD series ''[[Liken the Scriptures]]'' occasionally shows missionaries.
Missionaries were featured in the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary ''[[Get the Fire]]'' (2003), as well as in the [[Tony Award]]-winning satirical Broadway musical ''[[The Book of Mormon (musical)|The Book of Mormon]]''. Hollywood portrayed missionaries in ''[[Yes Man (film)|Yes Man]]'' (2008) starring [[Jim Carrey]], and British film ''[[Millions (2004 film)|Millions]]'' also mentioned missionaries.
Films portraying missionaries gone astray include ''[[Trapped by the Mormons]]'' (1922), ''[[Orgazmo]]'' (1997) and ''[[Latter Days]]'' (2003). Mormon missionaries appeared at the end of the American [[horror film]] ''[[The Strangers (2008 film)|The Strangers]]'' (2008); the missionaries were depicted as children as opposed to young men.
In 2008, former missionary Chad Hardy was subjected to [[Disciplinary council|church discipline]] after releasing a [[pin-up]] calendar titled &quot;Men on a Mission&quot;, which consisted of pictures of scantily clad returned missionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Lilly Fowler, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/05/AR2007100502146.html &quot;Calendar Shows Another Side of Mormons&quot;], ''[[Washington Post]]'', 2007-10-06, p.

'''Eddie Dowling''' (December 11, 1889&lt;ref name=&quot;baptismal&quot;&gt;Date and year of birth as per baptismal records of Precious Blood church, [[Woonsocket, Rhode Island]], where Dowling was christened&lt;/ref&gt; — February 18, 1976) was an [[United States|American]] [[actor]], [[screenwriter]], [[playwright]], director, [[theatrical producer|producer]], [[songwriter]] and [[composer]].
==Biography==
Born '''Joseph Goucher''' on December 11, 1889, he was the 14th of 17 children born to a father of French-Canadian descent and a mother of Irish descent in [[Woonsocket, Rhode Island]]. His middle name was either &quot;Narcisse&quot; or &quot;Nelson&quot; (varying sources). He took his professional surname from the maiden name of his mother, Bridget Mary Dowling, who was born in [[Smithfield, Rhode Island]]. His father was Charles Goucher who was born in [[Québec, Canada|St Marcel, Province of Québec, Canada]].&lt;ref name=&quot;baptismal&quot; /&gt;
He appeared on stage for many years, including appearances in the [[Ziegfeld Follies]].&lt;ref name=cullen&gt;Cullen, Frank and Hackman, Florence (2006). ''Vaudeville, Old and New: An Encyclopedia of Variety Performers in America'', pp. 322-23. Routledge. ISBN 0-415-93853-8.&lt;/ref&gt; His most famous role was as &quot;Tom Wingfield&quot; in the original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'', starring opposite [[Laurette Taylor]] and [[Julie Haydon]]. He produced the play's original Chicago production in 1944, and followed it to Broadway.&lt;ref name=cullen/&gt;
Dowling sought the 1934 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nomination for the [[United States Senate]] seat from [[Rhode Island]]. At the time, [[TIME magazine]] reported that his great-grandfather and two great-grand uncles were the founders of [[Goucher College]] for Women in Baltimore, and that &quot;he was the 14th in a family of 17 children; his schooling had extended only up to the third grade; he had been a cabin boy and a music hall singer ... and he owned a sausage factory in California.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,754076,00.html ''Time'' magazine description of Dowling]&lt;/ref&gt;
He was married to the [[Glasgow, Scotland]]-born actress and stage performer, [[Rachel Rice Dooley]] (October 30, 1888 — January 28, 1984) who specialized in [[physical comedy]]; they had two children, Jack and Maxine. Jack Dowling died serving in the World War II.
Eddie Dowling died in [[Smithfield, Rhode Island]] in 1976, at the age of 86. His widow died in 1984, aged 95, in [[East Hampton (village), New York|East Hampton, Long Island, New York]].

'''KFRH''' (104.3 [[FM broadcasting|FM]]) – branded as '''104.3 Now FM''' – is a commercial [[radio station]] in [[North Las Vegas, Nevada]], broadcasting to the [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] area on 104.3 [[FM Broadcasting|FM]].
KFRH airs a [[Contemporary Hit Radio|Top 40 (CHR)]] music format branded as &quot;104.3 Now FM&quot; with the slogan &quot;Vegas' New Hit Music Channel&quot;.
Its studios are in the unincorporated [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]] community of [[Enterprise, Nevada|Enterprise]] and the transmitter is on Potosi Mountains west of the Las Vegas Valley.
==History==
===Before 102.7 (1999–2009)===
KFRH was originally located at the 105.5 frequency and featured a Hot AC Format, in [[1999 in radio|1999]], a frequency swap took place in which a new frequency of 105.7 moved to the Las Vegas area and KFRH (which was KSTJ at the time) moved to the 102.7 frequency as a result. It had also debuted a 1980s hits format which carried moderate success, but in 2005, KMZQ-FM (now [[KXQQ-FM]]) debuted the Jack FM concept, with similar music being played on 100.5, with a bigger playlist, plus the shrinking of the 1980s formats in general Beasley decided to move KFRH back to a Hot AC format. On September 14, 2007 at 3PM, the station rebranded as &quot;Fresh 102.7&quot;. The last song on Star was &quot;[[Cum On Feel the Noize]]&quot; by [[Quiet Riot]] (a nod to the previous 80s hits format), whilst the first song on Fresh was &quot;[[Straight from the Heart (song)|Straight From The Heart]]&quot; by [[Bryan Adams]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://radioinsight.com/headlines/63/fresh-1027-las-vegas/]&lt;/ref&gt; The station's callsign was changed from '''KSTJ''' to KFRH to reflect the new format on October 5, [[2007 in radio|2007]].  Even though KFRH stayed [[hot adult contemporary]]; [[Mediabase]] had it on the hot AC panel before shifting to [[contemporary hit radio]].
===102.7 Now (2009)===
On April 1, [[2009 in radio|2009]] at 2PM, KFRH dropped its Hot AC format and began [[stunting (broadcasting)|stunting]] with a loop of voices asking &quot;When?&quot; followed by the occasional &quot;Soon&quot;, along with several songs with the word &quot;when&quot; in the title. At 4:33 PM, the station flipped to a [[Top 40]] format branded as '''102.7 Now''' with a commitment to play 102 straight minutes of uninterrupted music. The first song played on 102.7 Now was &quot;[[Right Now (Na Na Na)]]&quot; by [[Akon]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://radioinsight.com/headlines/netgnomes/856/fresh-102-7-kfrh-las-vegas-flipping-when/ “Fresh 102.7” KFRH Las Vegas Becomes CHR “102.7 Now”]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://formatchange.com/fresh-1027-las-vegas-becomes-1027-now/ “Fresh 102.7” Las Vegas Becomes “102.7 Now”]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also two other commercial radio stations in the United States that are branded similar, those being [[WBMP (FM)|WNOW]] &quot;92.3 Now FM&quot; in [[New York City|New York]], and [[KAMP-FM]] &quot;97.1 AMP Radio&quot; in [[Los Angeles]]. The station launched by playing music for 24 hours without commercial interruption. This was following the original campaign of playing &quot;10,000 Songs in a Row&quot;. The station also claimed to offer less commercials every hour than [[rhythmic contemporary]] competitor &quot;[[KLUC-FM|98.5 KLUC]]&quot;.
===104.3 Now FM (2009–present)===
The station switched to 104.3 from 102.7 on August 25, 2009. The station switched with sister Country station '''104.3 The Coyote''' ([[KCYE]]), which moved to the previous 102.7 frequency. The station leaned to a more Rhythmic format when it was previously broadcasting on 102.7, but has now changed to a complete Top 40 format adding more artists like The Weeknd, Calvin Harris, Ariana Grande, Sia, Coldplay, Justin Timberlake, Rihanna, Twenty-One Pilots, Bruno Mars, Ed Sheeran, Adele and Taylor Swift to compete with cross-town rival 98.5 KLUC, which also in 2008 leaned to a more CHR Top 40 format from previously broadcasting a Rhythmic format. Future plans also call for a call sign change, and on-air personalities will be added to the station.
==HD radio ==
KFRH airs the [[adult contemporary]] format formerly featured on the main channel on its [[HD Radio|HD2]] signal branded as &quot; Fresh FM.&quot; The third HD channel rebroadcasts [[NOAA Weather Radio]]'s [[WXL36]] to provide that service in an FM dial form.

'''IntegRate''' was a [[software]] product written in [[C++]] based on a pipe-lined high performance [[architecture (disambiguation)|architecture]] for handling batch [[rating of telecommunications]] using [[call detail record]]s (CDR), developed by the German software company Solution 42.
==Description==
The product was an early [[massively parallel (computing)|massively parallel]] application. It processed and charge thousands of events per second on commodity hardware. The software was able to run on the following operating systems: [[Windows]], [[Unix]]/[[Linux]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[HP-UX]] and [[AIX]]. It contained algorithms for ultra-fast [[regular expression]] matching using a [[finite-state machine]] as well as one of the first [[in-memory database]]s.
IntegRate platform is a conceptual structure for performing the complex task of [[telecommunications rating]] and price modeling. The &quot;framework&quot; contains &quot;pipelines&quot;, each of which consists of &quot;[[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]]s&quot;, which can be freely combined. The standard plug-ins cover rating tasks (e.g. zoning, service determination) and the overall rating process can be customized by using the IntegRate script languages &quot;iScript&quot; and &quot;iRule&quot;. This allows configuring plug-in modules to prepare or post-process CDR-information.
Solution42 (a name taken from [[Douglas Adams]]'s &quot;[[Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy]]&quot; cult series), originally based in [[Quickborn]], [[Germany]], was purchased by [[Portal Software]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/04/business/company-news-portal-software-in-deal-to-acquire-solution-42.html&lt;/ref&gt; Since the purchase of Solution42, the IntegRate architecture was integrated into the so-called &quot;Portal Infranet&lt;ref&gt;http://www.softscout.com/software/Accounting-and-Finance/Bill-and-Invoice-Generation/Infranet.html&lt;/ref&gt;&quot; telecommications billing platform, now called the Batch Rating Engine (BRE).
In 2006 [[Oracle Corporation]] acquired Portal Software.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/Acquisitions/portalsoftware/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; IntegRate became the central rating and mediation engine with Oracle's CBRM System.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/communications/billing-revenue-management/overview/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2003 the core engineers and lead architects of former Solution42 founded ENTEREST&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enterest.eu/&lt;/ref&gt; to build the successor product &quot;EDR Workbench&quot; marketed for [[complex event processing]] using the marketing term [[big data]].

[[File:Poi circles.jpg|thumb|right|A flower pattern from flow artist Nick Woolsey captured through long exposure photography; photograph is an example of [[light painting]]]]
'''Glowsticking''' is a form of [[object manipulation]] or [[dancing]] with [[glowstick]]s or other glowstick-like objects that share the same qualities: durability, consistency in light, safe to toss around, and the material of which they are made, often a soft and pliant [[plastic]].
''Glowsticking'' is an &quot;umbrella term&quot; describing two broad categories, with the most agreed upon separation being whether it is stringed or not stringed. More importantly, glowsticking has roots in the [[electronica]] and [[rave]] scenes, and has a cultural paradigm more in common with those scenes than those of other scenes. Some aspects include the culture of non-competitiveness, preferring sharing and performing in accordance with your observer, without any kind of negative statement implied. Because of this glowsticking competitions are frowned upon by most practitioners of glowsticking. Although glowsticking as a field can largely be practiced anywhere, the roots it has with raving has led to the adoption of most of the ideals of the rave scene. In recent days complete glow stick costumes have been created that attach to one's body, the two most popular being from Crayola and Glowstickables.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glowsticking.com/articles-and-tutorials/culture/71-glowsticking-culture/113-what-is-glowsticking.html What is Glowsticking?], ''Glowsticking.com Articles,'' 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
==Forms==
Both of these terms, freehand and glowstringing, describe the technical skills that relates to both. It is only when the practitioner intends to [[dance]] that it becomes glowsticking. Otherwise, they may be a [[juggler]] who is simply choosing to juggle glowsticks (in the case of freehand), or a poist who is doing [[poi (performance art)|poi]] with glowsticks. That is not to say that a juggler or a poist cannot dance if they so choose with glowsticks—just that glowsticking implies dancing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glowsticking.com/articles-and-tutorials/culture/71-glowsticking-culture/113-what-is-glowsticking.html Forms of Glowsticking.], ''Glowsticking.com Articles,'' 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
===Glowstringing===
Glowstringing is defined by a few factors: the use of glowsticks on a string, the swinging motion, and an equally large growing category of moves and concepts that share many of the same aspects as many other stringing related fields, such as [[poi (performance art)|poi]], [[yo-yo]]ing, and [[martial arts]] forms common with [[sword]]s, [[flail]]s, and [[rope dart]]s, is typically done with glowstick or glowstick-like instruments tied with a durable string at the end of it. In some case, handles may be used, because of moves which favor the fact that the glowstick handle can be grabbed and switched with the swinging part. In some cases, because of the existence of handles which glow both ways, moves which &quot;throw&quot; can be accomplished as it can be grabbed on either side.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glowsticking.com/articles-and-tutorials/culture/71-glowsticking-culture/113-what-is-glowsticking.html What is Glowstringing?], ''Glowsticking.com Articles,'' 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
===Freehand===
Freehand glowsticking is glowsticking typically practiced without strings attached to the glowsticks.  Freehand is defined by the steadily growing body of concepts and moves. Some of these concepts include tracing, taps, tossing, stalls and threading, as well as interdisciplinary dance skills borrowed from common [[funk style]] categories. Freehand glowsticking typically borrows from many other dance styles such as [[liquid dancing]] as well as having its own unique set of moves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glowsticking.com/articles-and-tutorials/culture/71-glowsticking-culture/113-what-is-glowsticking.html What is Freehand?], ''Glowsticking.com Articles,'' 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
Tracing is the act of dragging the glowsticks over the contours of one's body. An example of a common trace is the stomach trace, which includes dragging the glow sticks over one's stomach to create a circular pattern.  Another example of a basic movement frequently used in freehand glowsticking is the figure eight—quite possibly the most well known, albeit not the most common move in the intermediate and more advanced levels.
===Lightshows===
In the context of this article, a lightshow is a [[performance]] given with glowsticks to a small audience of one or several people which are physically close to the [[performer]]. Lightshow is a term that can be used loosely to refer to performances given with LED lights ([[light-emitting diodes]]), assorted [[light]] [[toy]]s, [[lasers]], and a variety of other &quot;light up&quot; items.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glowsticking.com/articles-and-tutorials/culture/71-glowsticking-culture/141-the-lightshow.html The Lightshow.], ''Glowsticking.com Articles,'' 02-13-2008&lt;/ref&gt;
==History and culture==
Although glowsticking has roots in the mid-1980s gay scene in the US at [[Saint (nightclub)|Saint nightclub]] in New York and in the UK at [[Heaven (nightclub)|Heaven nightclub]] before becoming popular in the early 1990s on the underground [[rave]] scene, they were used in Grateful Dead shows before the rave scene arrived, it has since become a separate cultural phenomenon that can be found throughout the general [[electronic dance music]] world, and is becoming popular in the [[twirling]] and [[:Category:Physical activity and dexterity toys|dexterity play]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Torgovnick K|title=Cheer!: Inside the Secret World of College Cheerleaders |publisher= [[Simon &amp; Schuster|Touchstone]] |location=New York, NY |year=2009 |pages= 117 |isbn=1-4165-3597-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There has been some who have claimed glowstringing is [[poi (performance art)|poi]] with [[glowstick]]s. This confusion is understandable, as the field of glowstringing is smaller and newer than the field of poi. Poi as a cultural art form is a hundreds of years old discipline coming from [[New Zealand]].
Glowstringing originally came from Poists who practiced the art at [[rave]]s, where glowsticks were probably advantageous compared to non-glowing objects. Many glowstringers can probably trace their roots to poi and many will often practice more poi at times than &quot;pure&quot; glowstringing.
Glowsticks were preferred by many in the rave scene in a way much similar to freehand's development, and were preferred in the rave scene to emit light for a numerous reasons, including its relative cheapness, their harmlessness and durability and their disposable nature, but has largely cemented glowsticks as an icon of the rave scene, sometimes negatively, which is why there was and is still such a large prevalence of glowstick use by freehanders and glowstringers alike.
The nature of the glowstick, allowing for concepts which would otherwise be impossible with other objects, has thus significantly influenced the development of both freehand and glowstringing. In freehand, the obvious shape of the glowstick is used in numerous ways to accent, or to catch, or to even create patterns of light or to accentuate body movement. In terms of glowstringing, glowsticks have significantly impacted former pure poists in order to take advantage of the glowstick. For example, linked catches and glowstick manipulations borrow far more from a [[yo-yo]] string manipulation concept than poi.
Over time, glowstringing, because of the cultural differences that resulted from many different reasons, has become its own category. In all, glowstringing belongs in the same category of swinging objects and object manipulation such as [[Poi (performance art)|Poi]], martial arts, [[yo-yo]]ing, [[Fire staff|staffing]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glowsticking.com/articles-and-tutorials/culture/71-glowsticking-culture/113-what-is-glowsticking.html An Explanation Of The History Of Freehand And Glowstringing.], ''Glowsticking.com Articles,'' 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
==Criticism==
The origin of &quot;ravers&quot; using glowsticks started when they used them to &quot;blow each other up&quot; by twirling glowsticks and LED lights in front of one another's face.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} This is thought to enhance the effects of the drug MDMA, or ecstasy, which is a popular drug among ravers and the rave scene. Some rave promoters have banned glowsticks from events, especially those taking place in confined spaces, due to the space required to glow stick and the potential danger of striking other rave goers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} In 2001, the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] tried but failed to ban glowsticks and other items from dance parties, mislabeling them &quot;drug paraphernalia.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/news/governments-war-raves-went-too-far-louisiana-court-rules Government's War on Raves Went Too Far, Louisiana Court Rules (8/24/2001)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Best of the Monkees''''' is a [[The Monkees|Monkees]] compilation released by [[Rhino Entertainment]]. It contains 25 songs from The Monkees' repertoire, listed in chronological order by release date. Also included is a Bonus [[karaoke]] CD with five tracks. Unlike previous Rhino compilations, this one does not include any material from the 1980s or 1990s reunions, focusing strictly on the band's 1960s output.
''The Best of the Monkees'' replaced ''[[Greatest Hits (1995 The Monkees album)|The Monkees Greatest Hits]]'', released in 1995 in anticipation of the band’s 30th Anniversary celebration the following year.
The album debuted on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in the issue dated May 17, 2003, at number 51. It spent six weeks on the chart. Following the death of member [[Davy Jones (actor)|Davy Jones]] on February 29, 2012, it re-entered at No. 20 with 17,000 copies sold (up 7,808 percent according to [[Nielsen SoundScan]]) for the week ending March 4, 2012. The album has since been certified Gold for selling 500,000 copies.

'''David Anthony Lucas''' (born 23 November 1977) is an English professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Fleetwood Town F.C.|Fleetwood Town]].
Lucas currently acts as the goalkeeper coach at Fleetwood, as well as retaining his registration as the club's senior goalkeeper. He has made 307 appearances in [[the Football League]], including 118 for [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]].
Lucas began his career at his hometown club Preston North End in the [[Football League Third Division]]. He spent time on loan at [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]], [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe United]], and [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], before signing for Sheffield Wednesday in 2004. He then joined rivals [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] in 2007, but only made three appearances for them before signing with [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] in the same year. After spending much of the [[2007-08 in English football|2007–08 season]] as an unused substitute, he began to establish himself as the first choice goalkeeper at Elland Road, impressing manager [[Gary McAllister]] with a series of good displays continuing into the following season. He made a number of appearances before being dropped in December, subsequently only appearing on the bench. He signed for [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] in June 2009. Lucas had a successful season in which he played a major part in Swindon reaching the [[Football League One play-offs]]. Lucas' contract with Swindon was terminated one year early by mutual consent, and he signed a one-year deal with [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]] on 3 August 2011, taking up a player/coach role. Lucas was released by Rochdale at the end of the season, before he signed a one-year contract with [[Football League Championship|Championship]] club [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] on 10 July 2012. He made one appearance before leaving when the January 2013 transfer window opened, to join League Two club Fleetwood Town, reuniting with former Preston North End teammates [[Graham Alexander]], now manager of Fleetwood, and first team coach [[Chris Lucketti]].
Lucas has played internationally for England, five times at under-18 and four times at under-20 level.
== Club career ==
=== Preston North End ===
As a young [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]], Lucas started his career at [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]]. He went on to spend nearly ten years as a professional at the [[Lancashire]] club, punctuated by loan appearances for [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]], [[Scunthorpe United F.C.|Scunthorpe]] and [[Sheffield Wednesday]]. Lucas was capped by [[England national under-18 football team|England under-18]] and [[England national under-20 football team|under-20]] teams while a Preston player.&lt;!--
there are no contemporary sources for him winning u21 caps: his profile at the FA gives U18 and U20 only, and he isn't in the list of U21 internationals in the Sky Sports annual

=== Sheffield Wednesday ===
Lucas had another spell at Sheffield Wednesday, having signed a permanent deal with the [[Yorkshire]] side in the summer of 2004 after impressing during his two loan spells the previous season. During Wednesday's promotion [[2004–05 in English football|season of 2004–05]], Lucas made 41 appearances for the team and totalled 15 [[clean sheet]]s, despite twice having to battle against injuries.
Lucas started the first 18 matches of Sheffield Wednesday's [[2005–06 in English football|2005–06]] campaign before a knee injury again ruled him out until January. His comeback was short-lived and Lucas was injured again against [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] on 4 February 2006 after playing only two full games; the new injury again ruled him out until January 2007.
Lucas announced that he would not be renewing his contract with Sheffield Wednesday at the end of the 2005–06 season, although he continued to receive treatment at their training ground whilst he was recovering from his knee injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/sheff_wed/5094912.stm |title=Keeper Lucas to quit Hillsborough |date=19 June 2006 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=1 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Barnsley ===
Lucas subsequently joined [[South Yorkshire]] rivals [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] on a free transfer in January 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/barnsley/6228877.stm |title=Barnsley snap up Lucas and McCann |date=3 January 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=1 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but only made three appearances for them. During his first game for Barnsley, he came out to deal with a high ball and collided with the [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] player [[Giles Barnes]]. He was knocked unconscious and left the field on a [[spinal board]] after several minutes' treatment.

'''Federal elections''' were held in Germany on 19 January 1919,&lt;ref name=NS&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] &amp; Stöver, P (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p762 ISBN 978-3-8329-5609-7&lt;/ref&gt; although members of the standing army in the east voted for their representatives only on 2 February. The elections were the first of the new [[Weimar Republic]] following [[World War I]] and the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|Revolution of 1918–19]]. It was also the first German election held using [[proportional representation]] and with [[women's suffrage]]. It is also reckoned as the first truly free and fair all-German election, as it was the first to be held after the scrapping of the old constituencies that grossly over-represented rural areas. The [[voting age]] was lowered to 20 from 25 in the last [[German federal election, 1912|Reichstag election of 1912]].
[[Austrian citizenship|Austrian citizens]] living in Germany were allowed to vote, in the same way that [[German citizenship|German citizens]] living in Austria were also allowed to vote in the [[Austrian Constitutional Assembly election, 1919|Austrian Constitutional Assembly election]] in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F30F1FFD3A5D147A93C4A81789D85F4D8185F9 Austria votes today. –  German Part of Former Dual Monarchy Chooses Its Constituent Assembly.], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 16 February 1919 ([[Portable Document Format|PDF]])&lt;/ref&gt;
From its inaugural session on 6 February, the [[Weimar National Assembly|National Assembly]] (''Nationalversammlung'') functioned as both a [[constituent assembly]] and [[unicameral legislature]]. On 13 February, provisional ''Reichspräsident'' (President) [[Friedrich Ebert]] appointed [[Philipp Scheidemann]] ''Reichsministerpräsident'' (Minister President, the office was renamed [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] only when the [[Weimar Constitution]] came into force in August 1919). [[Cabinet Scheidemann|Scheidemann's government]] replaced the revolutionary ''Rat der Volksbeauftragten'' ([[Council of the People's Deputies]]). The supporting parties of the &quot;[[Weimar Coalition]]&quot; ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]], [[Centre Party (Germany)|Zentrum]] and [[German Democratic Party|DDP]]) together won 76.2% of the votes cast. Voter turnout was 83.0%.&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p776&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Craig Doyle''' (born 17 December 1970 in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]) is an [[Irish people|Irish]] television and radio presenter. To British viewers he is recognisable as working for the [[BBC]] and [[ITV Network|ITV]]. To Irish viewers he is recognisable as working for [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]] (RTÉ), and as the host of [[RTÉ One]] chat show ''[[Tonight with Craig Doyle]]'' and [[RTÉ Two]]'s ''[[The Social (Irish TV series)|The Social]]'', now titled ''[[Craig Doyle Live]]'' and broadcast twice a week. He is a regular presenter on [[BT Sport]] rugby coverage.
==Early life==
Doyle grew up in the south Dublin suburb of [[Stillorgan]]. While he was being educated in [[Roman Catholic]] schools, the priests wanted Doyle to take to a religious career, but he originally wanted to be a [[Veterinarian|veterinary surgeon]]. He studied [[sociology]] and history at [[St Patrick's College, Maynooth]], followed by the [[London College of Printing]], where he earned a diploma in broadcast journalism.
==Broadcasting career==
After graduation, Doyle worked on local radio with BBC Radio Suffolk based in Ipswich, before moving on to [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] to present the children's show ''[[List of GMTV_programmes#The Disney Club|Disney Club]]'' In 1994, having been head hunted following a chance meeting with a producer from the show at a visit to Alton Towers.
Moving to London, he presented ''[[Tomorrow's World]]'', ''Fasten Your Seatbelt'' and ''Innovation Nation'', and spent six years hosting [[BBC One]]'s ''[[Holiday (TV series)|Holiday]]''. He also had a live music show on London's [[Capital Radio]] every Saturday 8am–11am.

The blue-haired woman is Marge Simpson who is playing Fay Wray to Homer's King Kong.

The '''Mastín Español''' or '''Spanish Mastiff''', is a giant [[breed]] of dog, originating in Spain, originally bred to be a [[guard dog]] whose specialized purpose is to be a [[Livestock guardian dog]] protecting flocks (and occasionally herds) from [[Gray wolf|wolves]] and other [[predator]]s.  The [[Mountain dog]] type has a heavier coat.
==Historical context==
[[File:ИСПАНСКИЙ МАСТИФ.JPG|thumb|right|Brindle colored Spanish Mastiff.]]
[[Transhumance]] in Spain is very ancient, like the primitive populations of those lands and, consequently, the Mastiff-Transhumance binomial. In the [[Iron Age]] of the [[Castile (historical region)|Castilian]] Plateau it found skeletons of dogs of enormous dimensions. Also is assumed that already in the [[Neolithic]] existed molossers in [[Central Europe]].{{fact|date=October 2016}}
In different parts of the globe, appeared simultaneously various types of cattle dogs of molosser type, one of these places was Spain considering the natural characteristics of the peninsula. Specifically the Spanish Mastiff was originated in the territories of [[Asturias]], [[Cantabria]], [[Province of León|León]] and [[Province of Zamora|Zamora]].&lt;ref&gt;[http: //listadoderazasdeperrosygatos.blogspot.com/2012/10/raza-mastin-espanol.html &quot;Raza de Perro Mastín Español (Spanish Mastiff)&quot; listadoderazasdeperrosygatos]&lt;/ref&gt;
Th [[Prehistoric Europe|Indo-Europeans]], some groups composed of warriors herders and nomadic transhumans, led to large herd molossers dogs the valleys and areas conducive to grass. In the seasons of transhumance it had to walk about thirty kilometers or more per day, which gathered other nine for grazing; without the ebb and continued during monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mastinespanol.org/mastin_espanol_raza.htm The breed - History&quot;, mastinespañol.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
With the birth of the farming system, the dogs became indispensable. There was probably external influences acting on the base structure of the native dogs. Through centuries of selection and specialization, and thanks to this ecological ring pressent in many countries of the world (man, sheep, dog and wolf), it gave life to a specimen of a physical and a useful dog.
After, in [[Middle Ages|Medieval times]], during centuries, the Mastín Español has accompanied the herds of transhumans [[sheep]]s that ran cañadas reales crossing from north to south Spain, defending the cattle of attack of [[wolf|wolves]] and other vermin; the Mastín had the protection of carlancas or carrancas, chunky metal necklaces with skewers. Its function was primarily protective, unlike its fellow [[Carea (type)|Carea Dogs]], whose function is grazing, driving the herds in response to indications of the shepherd &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Antón Burgos, Francisco Javier |title=Herding dogs in Spain. Origins and functionality|url=http://www.aepme.org/joomla/index.php/articulos-sobre-la-raza/225-perros-de-pastoreo-en-espana-fco-javier-anton-burgos|publisher=Spanish Association of Mastín Español Dog (AEPME) |date=2014 |accessdate=July 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some places it is known as ''perro merinero'' by accompany the [[Merino Sheep|Merino]] sheep breed.
The first breed standard of the Mastín was made by the [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale|FCI]] in 1946. In 1981 was created the Asociación Española del Perro Mastín Español, who organized a breeding program looking for the kind of large and strong mastiff of the past times, and drafted a new breed standard focused on recovering the old cattle dogs, fit as pets, and as guard dog and defense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miperro.info/2014/09/el-patron-racial-del-mastin-espanol.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
==Appearance==
The Spanish Mastiff is a very large and powerful dog, similar in appearance to the other Mastiff breeds.   They have a large powerful head and serious and vigilant expression
Males in this breed are {{convert|70|to|85|cm|in}} tall at the withers, and range from {{convert|50|to|70|kg|lb}}. Females are at least {{convert|65|cm|in}}, and weigh {{convert|40|to|60|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.dogbreedslist.info/all-dog-breeds/Spanish-Mastiff.html|title=The Spanish Mastiff}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It has small eyes and drop ears resembling triangles. This dog's coat is most often fawn-colored, but can also be brindle, black or 'wolf' colored. Reddish tones indicate miscegenation
==Temperament==
[[File:Mastspagn3.jpg|thumb|right|A couple of Spanish Mastiffs]]
This noble giant is aloof, dignified, calm and intelligent.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} It is devoted to its family and may politely accept strangers if it has been socialized properly, although it will be wary of them. It can be aggressive toward other dogs.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The Spanish Mastiff may be a less-than-ideal pet in urban situations, where its booming voice and massive size could be problematic. It is a wonderful protector of its home and family.  And an ideal protector of herds and flocks from wolf predation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wyadmb.com/2011%20Projects/Transferring%20successful%20Old%20World%20livestock%20protection%20dog%20traditions%20to%20areas%20of%20large%20carnivore%20occupancy%20in%20the%20United%20States.doc |title=Transferring successful Old World livestock protection dog traditions to areas of large carnivore occupancy in the United States (Livestock Protection Dog International Research Project Report) |first1=Jim |last1=Urbigkit |first2=Cat |last2=Urbigkit |first3=Yolanda, Editor |last3=Cortez  |publisher=Wyoming Wool Growers Association, Wyoming Animal Damage Management Board |format=MSWord doc |accessdate=February 27, 2017 |pages=1-46}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Socialization and training should begin early to ensure this dog a stable and reliable pet. Supervised exposure in puppy-hood to a variety of unfamiliar but non-threatening dogs will help dampen a tendency to aggression toward other dogs.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The breed is quite alert and food motivated but can bore easily; training must be consistent and firm but gentle. Once the trainer has established the dog's respect as leader, the Spanish Mastiff will be an extremely loyal pet.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}
==Exercise==
This dog is more inclined to lumber than gallop, but it can move quite rapidly when necessary. A long daily walk will be sufficient, although it will appreciate a fenced area where it can exercise at its own rate.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}
==Representatives dogs==
* [[Las Meninas]] by [[Diego Velázquez]] features an impressive example of the breed.
* Actor [[Viggo Mortensen]] has, by a gift when he was in León, both a Carea Leonés and a Leonese Mastiff, named &quot;Aragorn&quot; and &quot;Alatriste&quot;, named of characters he played in his movies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.escaparatedemascotas.com/famosos/viggo-mortensen/ &quot;Viggo Mortensen&quot; escaparatedemascotas.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Galt House''' is a 25-story, 1300-room [[hotel]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] established in 1972.  It is named for a nearby historic hotel erected in 1837 and demolished in 1921. The Galt House is the city's only hotel on the [[Ohio River]].
==Original Galt House==
[[Image:BullNelsonShooting.jpg|thumb|left|[[Union Army|Union]] Gen. [[Jefferson C. Davis]] shoots Union Gen. [[William &quot;Bull&quot; Nelson]] at the Galt House in 1862]]
The Galt House was, in the early 19th century, the residence of Dr. W.C. Galt.  The house was located at the corner of Second and Main Street.
In 1834, the first instance of the Galt House as a hotel was established and in 1835 was opened by Col. Ariss Throckmorton as a 60-room hotel on the northeast corner of Second and Main streets in Louisville.  During the nineteenth century, The Galt House was acclaimed as Louisville's best hotel. Many noted people stayed at the original Galt House, including [[Jefferson Davis]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Ulysses S. Grant]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}
During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the Galt House was utilized for meetings of [[Union Army|Union]] generals. In September 1862, it was the scene of an unusual murder, when General [[Jefferson C. Davis]] (not to be confused with [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] President [[Jefferson Davis]]) shot Union General [[William &quot;Bull&quot; Nelson]] after a dispute.
According to a historical marker for the original Galt House, in March 1864, Generals [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] met at the Galt House to plan the invasion that led to the [[Atlanta Campaign|successful capture of Atlanta, Georgia]] and [[Sherman's March to the Sea]].  As of 2014, this claim has fallen into dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bullard |first=Gabe |date=2014-03-16 |title=No, Ulysses S. Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman Didn't Plan the March to the Sea in Louisville |url=http://wfpl.org/post/no-ulysses-s-grant-and-william-tecumseh-sherman-didnt-plan-march-sea-louisville |location=Louisville, Kentucky |publisher=[[WFPL]] |accessdate=2014-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
What was to be the first Galt House burned down in 1865.  Four years later, in 1869, a larger Galt House was established on the corner of First and Main streets.  Known as being the center of Louisville's social community during this time, the hotel subsequently fell on hard times in the next 50 years and was closed in 1919 due to financial difficulties.  Soon after, in 1921, the building was demolished.
==Current Galt House==
Over a half a century later, in 1972, the Galt House Hotel was reestablished by developer Al J Schneider as part of Louisville's Riverfront Urban Renewal Project.  The West (RIVUE) Tower is 25 stories high and features deluxe guest rooms.  An East (Suite) Tower was added in 1984.  It offers 650 suites, including waterfront balcony suites and waterfront apartments.  At nearly 1,300 guest rooms, Galt House Hotel is the largest hotel in [[Kentucky]]. It has 128,000 square feet of meeting space, including 53 meeting rooms, two ballrooms and an exhibit hall.  On-site there are six restaurants, a business and shipping center, a spa and salon, a barbershop and retail shops.  Every year since 1986, the statewide [[Governor's Cup (academics)|Governor's Cup]] has been held at the Galt House Hotel.  It is the Official Hotel of Churchill Downs and the Kentucky Derby.
Al J Schneider's daughter, Mary Moseley, became President and CEO of the company and has led a more than $70 million renovation of the Galt House Hotel.  Under her leadership, many updates and renovations have been completed, including the addition of a 3-story glass-jewel Conservatory that links the Suite and RIVUE Towers over Fourth Street. The {{convert|10000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} conservatory is three stories in height and enclosed by steel and glass. It features a cafe, a cocktail lounge and gathering area, an [[aviary]] and [[greenhouse]] space on one level with large trees and [[foliage]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Mithridates''' (in [[Greek language|Greek]] Mιθριδάτης; lived 4th century BCE), son of [[Ariobarzanes I of Cius|Ariobarzanes]] prince of [[Cius]], is mentioned by [[Xenophon]]{{r|xen1_8.8.4}} as having betrayed his father, and the same circumstance is alluded to by [[Aristotle]].{{r|aris_5.10}}
He may or may not be the same [[Mithridates (soldier)|Mithradates]] who accompanied the younger [[Cyrus the Younger|Cyrus]], or the same [[Mithradates, Satrap of Cappadocia|Mithradates]] mentioned by Xenophon{{r|xen2_7.8.25}} as [[satrap]] of [[Cappadocia]] and [[Lycaonia]] in the late 5th century BCE.
During the [[Revolt of the Satraps|Satraps' Revolt]] in the 360s BCE, Mithridates tricked [[Datames]] to believe in him, but in the end arranged Datames' murder in 362 BCE. Similarly, Mithridates gave his own father [[Ariobarzanes of Phrygia]] to the hands of the Persian overlord, so Ariobarzanes was crucified in 362 BCE.
[[Demosthenes]] speaks of Ariobarzanes and his three sons having been lately made [[Athens|Athenian]] citizens.{{r|dem1}} - as signal of sympathy in the revolt effort, Athens made Ariobarzanes and three of his sons citizens of Athens. Mithradates was possibly one of those sons.
In 363 BCE already, [[Ariobarzanes II of Cius|Ariobarzanes II]] (possibly Mithridates' son) made himself master of the family fiefdom of Cius in [[Mysia]].{{r|diod_15.90}} This Mithradates may therefore have died in 363 BCE, but the date is not recorded and only comes from later reconstructions of the succession in the dynasty.
Otherwise, this Mithradates may well be the same man as the elderly [[Mithridates II of Cius]] who held Cius in Mysia between 337 and 302 BCE, being said to be an old man at that time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alonso de Castillo''' (1584?, probably in [[Tordesillas]], [[Valladolid (province)|Valladolid]]{{snd}}1647?, probably in [[Palermo]]) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] novelist and playwright.
He is said to have been [[Baptism|baptized]] October 1, 1584. He is next heard of at [[Madrid]] in 1619 as a man of literary tastes. While in the service of the [[Pierre de Villars|Marquis de Villars]], he issued his first work, ''Donaires del Parnaso'' (1624–1625), two volumes of humorous poems; his ''Tardes entretenidas'' (1625) and ''Jornadas alegres'' (1626) proved that he was a novelist by vocation.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Castillo Solórzano, Alonso de|volume=5|page=476|first=James|last=Fitzmaurice-Kelly|authorlink=James Fitzmaurice-Kelly}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Shortly afterwards he joined the household of the [[Pedro Fajardo, 5th Marquis of Los Vélez|Marquis de los Vélez]], [[Viceroy]] of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], and published in quick succession three clever [[picaresque novel]]s: ''La Niña de los embustes, Teresa de Manzanares'' (1634), ''Las Aventuras del Bachiller Trapaza'' (1637), and a continuation entitled ''La Garduña de Sevilla y Anzuelo de las bolsas'' (1642). To these shrewd cynical stories he owes his reputation.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;
He followed the Marquis de los Vélez in his disastrous campaign in [[Catalonia]] (the [[Reapers' War]]) and accompanied him to [[Rome]], where the defeated general was sent as ambassador. Castillo Solórzano's death occurred before 1648, but the exact date is uncertain. His prolonged absence from Madrid prevented him from writing as copiously for the stage as he would otherwise have done; but he was popular as a playwright both at home and abroad. His ''Marqués del Cigarral'' and ''El Mayorazgo figurón'' are the sources respectively of [[Paul Scarron|Scarron]]'s ''Don Jophet d'Arménie'' and ''L'Héritier ridicule''. Among his numerous remaining works may be mentioned ''Las harpías en Madrid'' (1633), ''Fiestas del Jardín'' (1634), ''Los Alivios de Casandra'' (1640) and the posthumous ''Quinta de Laurel'' (1649); the witty observation of these books forms a singular contrast to the prim devotion of his ''Sagrario de Valencia'' (1635).&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1911&quot;/&gt;

The '''[[Knight Street]] Bridge''' is a [[cantilever bridge]] which spans the North Arm of the [[Fraser River]] in [[British Columbia]], connecting [[Vancouver]] and [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]], and serving as a feeder route for [[List of British Columbia provincial highways|Highways]] [[British Columbia Highway 91|91]] and [[British Columbia Highway 99|99]] to its south. It is located to the east of the [[Oak Street Bridge]]. Besides spanning the river, the bridge also provides access to [[Mitchell Island]]. The bridge has a length of 1436 metres&lt;ref name=&quot;TH&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.th.gov.bc.ca/publications/frontiertofreeway/frontiertofreeway.pdf |title=Frontier to Freeway: A short illustrated history of the roads in British Columbia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has clearances of 12.2 by 79.2 metres over the north channel, and 20.1 by 109.7 metres for the south channel. The northern section carries six lanes of traffic, while the southern section carries four. 
The bridge has the distinction of having the most bridge motor vehicle accidents in BC. In addition, the bridge's interchange with Marine Drive is in the top three intersections for motor vehicle accidents in BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/westcoastnews/story.html?id=29765c8a-1397-479d-ab35-2f1a20c41f8b Accident-prone Metro home to all top 10 crash sites], ''Vancouver Sun'', November 12, 2009. Accessed online January 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[TransLink (British Columbia)|TransLink]], the regional transportation authority, is responsible for the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.translink.ca/en/Getting-Around/Driving/Traffic-Cameras/Bridges-and-Tunnels/Knight-St-Bridge.aspx Knight St Bridge], TransLink&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
The bridge was built to replace an obsolete span linking the south end of Fraser Street with No. 5 Road in Richmond via [[Mitchell Island]]. The Fraser Street Bridge was a through truss built in 1905 with a swing span on the northern side of Mitchell Island. The channel was difficult to navigate, making collisions with ships and barges routine. The height of the Knight Street bridge alleviated this problem. 
The construction of the Knight Street Bridge took 5 years, costing about $15 million including the approaches. Electric heating cables were installed in the deck to minimize the use of de-icing salt in the winter.&lt;ref name=&quot;VanHist&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vancouverhistory.ca/chronology1974.htm |title=The History of Metropolitan Vancouver - 1974 Chronology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bridge also carries a water pipe and a gas pipe, with the former being the only water supply to Mitchell Island at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;watermain&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.richmond.ca/__shared/assets/061200_item251214.pdf |title=City of Richmond: Report to Committee re: Knight Street Bridge Watermain}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bridge opened on January 15, 1974, and the [[Fraser Street Bridge]] was dismantled the next month.&lt;ref name=&quot;VanHist&quot;/&gt;
On January 15, 2000 the boom of a mobile crane transported on a barge named ''T.L. Sharpe'', towed by the ''Sea Cap XII'', struck the underside of the Knight Street Bridge at 1:45 PM, damaging the bridge and the fixtures secured underneath its deck. The impact caused the boom to bend and the crane to slide off the barge and sink, and the bridge was closed to traffic for about 48 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tsb.gc.ca/eng/rapports-reports/marine/2000/m00w0005/m00w0005.asp |title=Transportation Safety Board of Canada - MARINE REPORTS - 2000 - M00W0005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water supply to Mitchell Island via the bridge was shut down for 25 days, and an emergency bypass water supply from Vancouver was installed.&lt;ref name=&quot;watermain&quot;/&gt; The incident prompted the City of Richmond to install a second water main to Mitchell Island in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.richmond.ca/__shared/assets/Annual_Report_20025953.pdf |title=City of Richmond: 2002 Annual Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:PerformanceEnvelope.gif|300px|thumb|Flight envelope diagram.]]
In [[aerodynamics]], the '''flight envelope''', '''service envelope''', or '''performance envelope''' of an [[aircraft]] refers to the capabilities of a design in terms of [[airspeed]] and [[Load factor (aeronautics)|load factor]] or altitude.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?type=simple;c=ecfr;cc=ecfr;sid=a8f38006e777ba46ba8000f7c2fe6641;region=DIV1;q1=23.335;rgn=div8;view=text;idno=14;node=14%3A1.0.1.3.10.3.70.8 §23.333 Flight envelope]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.access.gpo.gov/ecfr/graphics/pdfs/ec28se91.001.pdf Flight envelope - diagram] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601204507/http://www.access.gpo.gov/ecfr/graphics/pdfs/ec28se91.001.pdf |date=June 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is somewhat loosely applied, and can also refer to other measurements such as maneuverability. When a plane is pushed, for instance by diving it at high speeds, it is said to be flown &quot;outside the envelope&quot;, something considered rather dangerous.
Flight envelope is one of a number of related terms that are all used in a similar fashion. It is perhaps the most common term because it is the oldest, first being used in the early days of test flying. It is closely related to more modern terms known as '''extra power''' and a '''doghouse plot''' which are different ways of describing a flight envelope. In addition, the term has been widened in scope outside the field of engineering, to refer to the strict limits in which an event will take place or more generally to the '''predictable behavior''' of a given phenomenon or situation, and hence, its &quot;flight envelope&quot; .
==Extra power==
Extra power, or ''specific excess power'',&lt;ref name=&quot;MFHap&quot;/&gt; is a very basic method of determining an aircraft's flight envelope. It is easily calculated, but as a downside does not tell very much about the actual performance of the aircraft at different altitudes. 
Choosing any particular set of parameters will generate the needed power for a particular aircraft for those conditions. For instance a [[Cessna 150]] at 2,500&amp;nbsp;ft (800 m) altitude and 90&amp;nbsp;mph (140&amp;nbsp;km/h) speed needs about 60&amp;nbsp;hp (45&amp;nbsp;kW) to fly straight and level. The C150 is normally equipped with a 100&amp;nbsp;hp (75&amp;nbsp;kW) engine, so in this particular case the plane has 40&amp;nbsp;hp (30&amp;nbsp;kW) of extra power. In overall terms this is very little extra power, 60% of the engine's output is already used up just keeping the plane in the air. The leftover 40&amp;nbsp;hp (30&amp;nbsp;kW) is all that the aircraft has to maneuver with, meaning it can climb, turn, or speed up only a small amount. To put this in perspective, the C150 could not maintain a 2[[g-force|''g'']] (20&amp;nbsp;m/s²) turn, which would require 120&amp;nbsp;hp (or somewhat more) under the same conditions.
For the same conditions a [[fighter aircraft]] might require considerably more power due to their wings being inefficient at low speeds, for argument's sake it might require 10,000&amp;nbsp;hp (7.5 MW). However modern jet engines can provide considerable power, the equivalent of 50,000&amp;nbsp;hp (37 MW) typically. With this amount of extra power the aircraft can achieve very high maximum [[rate of climb]], even climb straight up, make powerful continual maneuvers, or fly at very high speeds.
==Doghouse plot==
[[Image:AltitudeEnvelopeText.GIF|thumb|Altitude envelope]]
[[Image:TurnRateEnvelope.GIF|thumb|Turn rate envelope]]
A doghouse plot generally shows the relation between speed at level flight and altitude, although other variables are also possible. It takes more effort to make than an extra power calculation, but in turn provides much more information such as ideal flight altitude. The plot typically looks something like an upside-down U and is commonly referred to as a doghouse plot due to its resemblance to a doghouse. The diagram on the right shows a very simplified plot which shall be used to explain the general shape of the plot.
The outer edges of the diagram, the envelope, show the possible conditions that the aircraft can reach in straight and level flight. For instance, the aircraft described by the black altitude envelope on the right can fly at altitudes up to about 52,000 feet, at which point the thinner air means it can no longer climb. The aircraft can also fly at up to Mach 1.1 at sea level, but no faster. This outer surface of the curve represents the ''zero-extra-power condition''. All of the area under the curve represents conditions that the plane can fly at with power to spare, for instance, this aircraft can fly at Mach 0.5 at 30,000 feet while using less than full power.
In the case of high-performance aircraft, including fighters, this &quot;1-g&quot; line showing straight-and-level flight is augmented with additional lines showing the maximum performance at various g loadings. In the diagram at right, the green line represents, 2-g, the blue line 3-g, and so on. The [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]] has a very small area just below Mach 1 and close to sea level where it can maintain a 9-g turn.
Flying outside the envelope is possible, since it represents the straight-and-level condition only. For instance diving the aircraft allows higher speeds, using gravity as a source of additional power. Likewise higher altitude can be reached by first speeding up and then going ballistic, a maneuver known as a [[zoom climb]].
===Stalling speed===
All [[fixed-wing aircraft]] have a minimum speed at which they can maintain level flight, the [[stall speed]] (left limit line in the diagram). As the aircraft gains altitude the stall speed increases; since the wing is not growing any larger the only way to support the aircraft's weight with less air is to increase speed. While the exact numbers will vary widely from aircraft to aircraft, the nature of this relationship is typically the same; plotted on a graph of speed (x-axis) vs. altitude (y-axis) it forms a diagonal line.
===Service ceiling===
Inefficiencies in the wings also make this line &quot;tilt over&quot; with increased altitude, until it becomes horizontal and no additional speed will result in increased altitude. This maximum altitude is known as the [[service ceiling]] (top limit line in the diagram), and is often quoted for aircraft performance. The area where the altitude for a given speed can no longer be increased at level flight is known as ''zero rate of climb'' and is caused by the [[Lift (force)|lift]] of the aircraft getting smaller at higher altitudes, until it no longer exceeds [[gravity]].
===Top speed===
The right side of the graph represents the maximum speed of the aircraft. This is typically sloped in the same manner as the stall line due to air resistance getting lower at higher altitudes, up to the point where an increase in altitude no longer increases the maximum speed due to lack of oxygen to feed the engines.
The power needed varies almost linearly with altitude, but the nature of [[drag (physics)|drag]] means that it varies with the square of speed—in other words it is typically easier to go higher than faster, up to the altitude where lack of oxygen for the engines starts to play a significant role.
==Velocity vs. load factor chart==
[[File:F-104A flight envelope.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A V-n diagram showing V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; (stall speed at 1G), V&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; (corner/maneuver speed) and V&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; (dive speed)]]
A chart of velocity versus load factor (or V-n diagram) is another way of showing limits of aircraft performance. It shows how much load factor can be safely achieved at different airspeeds.&lt;ref name=&quot;MFHap&quot;&gt;Sinclair, Edward J. [http://www.usarmyaviation.com/studyguides/index.php?folder=Documents/General%20Studyguides&amp;download=Maneuvering%20Flight%20Handbook%2024%20MAR%2005.pdf &quot;The Army Aviator's Handbook for Maneuvering Flight and Power Management&quot;]. p. 25. ''[[United States Army Aviation Branch]]'', 24 March 2005. Accessed: 6 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Sidenotes==
Although it is easy to compare aircraft on simple numbers such as maximum speed or service ceiling, an examination of the flight envelope will reveal far more information. Generally a design with a larger area under the curve will have better all-around performance. This is because when the plane is not flying at the edges of the envelope, its extra power will be greater, and that means more power for things like climbing or maneuvering. [[General aviation]] aircraft have very small flight envelopes, with speeds ranging from perhaps 50 to 200&amp;nbsp;mph, whereas the extra power available to modern fighter aircraft result in huge flight envelopes with many times the area. As a tradeoff however, military aircraft often have a higher stalling speed. As a result of this the landing speed is also higher.

This phrase is used to refer to an aircraft being taken to, and perhaps beyond, its designated altitude and speed limits.&lt;ref name=&quot;mqPush&quot;&gt;Quinion, Michael. [http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-pus1.htm Push the envelope] ''World Wide Words''. Accessed: 6 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; By extension, this phrase may be used to mean testing other limits, either within aerospace or in other fields e.g. [[Plus ultra (motto)]].&lt;ref&gt;G.W.

This article was last weeks [[Wikipedia:This week's improvement drive|Improvement drive]]. What more do people think needs to be done for this article to reach featured article status? I know the enemies section is still a bit messy, I'll try to get round to fixing that up soon. [[User:Jacoplane|Jacoplane]] 20:47, 29 July 2005 (UTC)
:Its getting there, good work and keep at it.  
:# I tried to smooth out the intro a bit, and I'm sure my attempt and can improved upon.  
:# &quot; as Mario games specifically lack over-complicated plots or too much character development so as to not limit his future roles.&quot; - That's a bit POV - who's to say what's over-complicated?
:# Biography needs to be longer
:# Minor grammer issues throughout article
:# Under abilities and techniques maybe a table or something with pictures for each transform would be good (although maybe a bit wishlist-y)
:# &quot;Many contend that Mario first appeared in the video game Donkey Kong as Jumpman (Shigeru Miyamoto, his creator, contends that Mario is a descendant of Jumpman and not Jumpman himself)&quot; as opposed to...?
:# There's a couple one sentence paragraphs in there
:and of course what you mentioned about the bestiary. --[[User:RN|RN]] 22:46, 29 July 2005 (UTC)
::Thanks for fixing up the intro. And thanks for your feedback. You some insightful comments, they give us a good starting point to improve the article, thx! [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Computer and video games|We'll]] take your comments into account, we hope to have Mario on the front page soon ;) [[User:Jacoplane|Jacoplane]] 22:58, 29 July 2005 (UTC)
::I tried to objectivize the sentence you cite in your second point, in the article's [[Mario#Biography|Biography section]]. I also replaced en-dashes (''-'') with em-dashes (''—'') throughout the whole article where applicable. I would appreciate some assistance in adding some information to Mario's biography; I believe it can be said he is somewhat lazy (falling to sleep if inactive in ''Super Mario Sunshine'', if I recall correctly) and gourmand (as his plump appearance seems to indicate), though he livens up if the situation calls for it. Added to that, he cares for the wellbeing of other people (frequently saving the Mushroom Kingdom) and is a sensitive character (love interest with Princess Peach). Do others have suggestions or comments? Thanking you, [[User:GrumpyTroll|Grumpy Troll]] [[User_talk:GrumpyTroll|(talk)]] 17:41, 6 August 2005 (UTC).
:::Get rid of the list of characters; takes up too much space, and this information should be condensed to sections/paragraphs on Wario, Luigi, Princess Peach and King Bowser. Same with the moves; like Wario has done, don't do a list, take the most important ones. -- [[User:A Link to the Past|A Link to the Past]] 15:58, August 9, 2005 (UTC)
::I went ahead and rewrote the biography intro sentence to make a little more sense and be a bit less absolutist... it might need some minor tweaking --&lt;small&gt;[[User:RN|Ryan Norton]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#6BA800&quot;&gt;[[User talk:RN|T]]&lt;/font&gt; | &lt;font color=&quot;#0033FF&quot;&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/RN|@]]&lt;/font&gt; | &lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;[[Special:Contributions/RN|C]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/small&gt; 16:27, 9 August 2005 (UTC)
*Images should have fair use rationale.  See [[Wikipedia:Image_description_page|image description page]] --[[User:ZeWrestler|&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;ZeWrestler&lt;/span&gt;]]  [[user talk:ZeWrestler|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:05, 11 August 2005 (UTC)
**Yes I just realised this not too long ago. I've just added the fair use rational in all the images linked to from [[Wario]], (See [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Wario]]) .. I'm going to do it for this article too. Thanks for the feedback. I find this whole situation a bit unclear though, and I wonder how ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' became a featured article when the images found in that article have no fair use rationale.
***I didn't realize it until the peer review for [[Final Fantasy VI]].(Which i'm working on right now)  ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' probally either slipped through the cracks, or the policy was not affect at the time of the creation.  I'll work a little bit on that pictures from that article. --[[User:ZeWrestler|&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;ZeWrestler&lt;/span&gt;]]  [[user talk:ZeWrestler|&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:44, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Pauline Flanagan''' (29 June 1925 – 28 June 2003) was a [[County Sligo]]-born [[Irish people|Irish]] [[actor|actress]] who had a long career on [[theatre|stage]]. [[United States|American]] television audiences best knew her as Maeve Ryan's sister, Annie Colleary, on the [[soap opera]] ''[[Ryan's Hope]]'' in 1979 and again in 1981. She later returned to the show as Sister Mary Joel.
==Life==
Her family was deeply political and supported the Republican (anti-Treaty) side during the [[Irish Civil War]].

The '''American Advertising Awards''', formerly the ADDY Awards, is the advertising industry's largest and most representative competition, attracting more than 40,000 entries every year in local [[American Advertising Federation]] Club (Ad Club) competitions. The mission of the American Advertising Awards competition is to recognize and reward the creative spirit of excellence in the art of advertising.
Conducted annually by the [[American Advertising Federation (AAF)]], the local Ad Club phase is the first of a three-tier, national competition. Concurrently, all across the country, local entrants vie to win ADDY Awards - recognition as the very best in their markets. At the second tier, local ADDY winners compete against winners from other local clubs in one of 15 district competitions. District ADDY winners are then forwarded to the third tier, the national stage of the American Advertising Awards. Entry in your local Ad Club competition is the first step toward winning a national ADDY.
Entering the American Advertising Awards supports the entire advertising industry, because the AAF and its local and district affiliates use the proceeds to enhance advertising through programs such as public service, internships, advocacy groups, advertising education, and consumer awareness.
Selection of the most creative entry in each category is affected by a scoring process in which a panel of judges evaluates all creative dimensions of every entry. A GOLD ADDY is recognition of the highest level of creative excellence and is judged to be superior to all other entries in the category. Entries that are also considered outstanding and worthy of recognition receive a SILVER ADDY. The number of awards given in each category is determined by the judges, based on the relative quality of work in that category.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanadvertisingawards.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brownsburg-Chatham''' is a municipality in the [[Laurentides]] region of Quebec, Canada, part of the [[Argenteuil Regional County Municipality]]. It is located along the [[Ottawa River]], just west of [[Lachute]], and includes the communities of Brownsburg, Cushing, Dalesville, Greece's Point, Pine Hill, and Saint-Philippe. Economic activities include agriculture, tourism and the manufacture of explosives.
It is the hometown of [[Gilles Lupien]], retired defenceman of the [[Montreal Canadiens]].
==History==
Chatham Township was established in 1799, and named after English Statesman [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham]] (1708–1778). Mostly populated by rich American [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]], its post office opened in 1829 and the township municipality was formed in 1845. By the mid-19th century, there were a few hamlets including Dalesville, Brownsbury, and Starneville.&lt;ref name=&quot;toponymie&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toponymie.gouv.qc.ca/CT/toposweb/Fiche.aspx?no_seq=375817 |title=Brownsburg-Chatham (Ville) |accessdate=2010-06-09 |publisher=Commission de toponymie du Québec |language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1818, Major George Brown, born in England, was granted by the government land on the West River (''Rivière de l'Ouest''). Together with pioneers Daniel Smith and Captain A. L. Howard, he was able to breathe life into the local industry during the 1820s. George Brown built, among other achievements, a sawmill and gristmill which contributed to the economic growth of the region and led to the formation of Brownsburg village which was named after him. In 1854, the Brownsburg Post Office opened. Later in the third quarter of the 19th century, a major arms factory run by the [[Canadian Industries Limited|Dominion Cartridge Company]] was the major local industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;toponymie&quot;/&gt;
In 1935, the Village Municipality of Brownsburg was officially established by separating from the Township Municipality of Chatham.&lt;ref name=&quot;toponymie&quot;/&gt;
On October 6, 1999, Brownsburg was rejoined with Chatham and the new Municipality of Brownsburg-Chatham was formed. On July 6, 2002, the municipality changed its statutes and became the Town of Brownsburg-Chatham.&lt;ref name=&quot;toponymie&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Below is a list of '''special elections''' to the [[United States House of Representatives]]. Such elections are called by [[Governor (United States)|state governors]] to fill vacancies that occur when a member of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] dies or resigns before the biennial [[general election]]. Winners of these elections serve the remainder of the term and are usually candidates in the next general election for their districts.
In the United States, these contests have been called &quot;special elections&quot; because they do do occur on [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]] like regular congressional elections.  Despite their name, however, special elections to the U.S. House happen quite often.  Furthermore, one published study shows that special elections are explained by the same factors as regular congressional elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Knotts | first1=H. Gibbs | last2=Ragusa | first2=Jordan | date=2016 | title=The Nationalization of Special Elections for the U.S. House of Representatives | url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17457289.2015.1063497 | journal=Journal of Elections, Public Opinion, and Parties | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | volume=26 | issue=1 | pages=22–39 | doi=10.1080/17457289.2015.1063497 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Special elections to the U.S. House of Representatives have occurred at least once in all states except Iowa and Idaho. A few special elections for territorial delegates to Congress have also been held.
